```

Flag for `setApplicationEnabledSetting(String,int,int)` and
`setComponentEnabledSetting(ComponentName,int,int)`: This
component or application is in its default enabled state (as specified in
its manifest).

Explicitly setting the component state to this value restores it's
enabled state to whatever is set in the manifest.

Constant Value:
0
(0x00000000)

### COMPONENT\_ENABLED\_STATE\_DISABLED

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

Installation scenario indicating a bulk operation with the desired result of a fully
optimized application. If the system is busy or resources are scarce the system will
perform less work to avoid impacting system health.
Examples of bulk installation scenarios might include device restore, background updates of
multiple applications, or user-triggered updates for all applications.
The decision to use BULK or BULK\_SECONDARY should be based on the desired user experience.
BULK\_SECONDARY operations may take less time to complete but, when they do, will produce
less optimized applications. The device state (e.g. memory usage or battery status) should
not be considered when making this decision as those factors are taken into account by the
Package Manager when acting on the installation scenario.

### MATCH\_DIRECT\_BOOT\_AUTO

Added in [API level 29](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int MATCH_DIRECT_BOOT_AUTO
```

Querying flag: automatically match components based on their Direct Boot
awareness and the current user state.

Since the default behavior is to automatically apply the current user
state, this is effectively a sentinel value that doesn't change the
output of any queries based on its presence or absence.

Instead, this value can be useful in conjunction with
`StrictMode.VmPolicy.Builder.detectImplicitDirectBoot()`
to detect when a caller is relying on implicit automatic matching,
instead of confirming the explicit behavior they want, using a
combination of these flags:

* `MATCH_DIRECT_BOOT_AWARE`
* `MATCH_DIRECT_BOOT_UNAWARE`
* `MATCH_DIRECT_BOOT_AUTO`

Constant Value:
268435456

### MATCH\_DIRECT\_BOOT\_AWARE

Added in [API level 24](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int MATCH_DIRECT_BOOT_AWARE
```

Querying flag: match components which are direct boot *aware* in
the returned info, regardless of the current user state.

When neither `MATCH_DIRECT_BOOT_AWARE` nor
`MATCH_DIRECT_BOOT_UNAWARE` are specified, the default behavior is
to match only runnable components based on the user state. For example,
when a user is started but credentials have not been presented yet, the
user is running "locked" and only `MATCH_DIRECT_BOOT_AWARE`
components are returned. Once the user credentials have been presented,
the user is running "unlocked" and both `MATCH_DIRECT_BOOT_AWARE`
and `MATCH_DIRECT_BOOT_UNAWARE` components are returned.

**See also:**

* `UserManager.isUserUnlocked()`

Constant Value:
524288

### MATCH\_DIRECT\_BOOT\_UNAWARE

Added in [API level 24](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int MATCH_DIRECT_BOOT_UNAWARE
```

Querying flag: match components which are direct boot *unaware* in
the returned info, regardless of the current user state.

When neither `MATCH_DIRECT_BOOT_AWARE` nor
`MATCH_DIRECT_BOOT_UNAWARE` are specified, the default behavior is
to match only runnable components based on the user state. For example,
when a user is started but credentials have not been presented yet, the
user is running "locked" and only `MATCH_DIRECT_BOOT_AWARE`
components are returned. Once the user credentials have been presented,
the user is running "unlocked" and both `MATCH_DIRECT_BOOT_AWARE`
and `MATCH_DIRECT_BOOT_UNAWARE` components are returned.

```
public static final int MATCH_DISABLED_UNTIL_USED_COMPONENTS
```

`PackageInfo` flag: include disabled components which are in
that state only because of `COMPONENT_ENABLED_STATE_DISABLED_UNTIL_USED`
in the returned info. Note that if you set this flag, applications
that are in this disabled state will be reported as enabled.

Constant Value:
32768
(0x00008000)

resulted if applications have been deleted with flag
`DELETE_KEEP_DATA` with a possibility of being replaced or
reinstalled in future.

Note: this flag may cause less information about currently installed
applications to be returned.

Note: use of this flag requires the android.permission.QUERY\_ALL\_PACKAGES
permission to see uninstalled packages.

Constant Value:
8192
(0x00002000)

### PROPERTY\_COMPAT\_OVERRIDE\_LANDSCAPE\_TO\_PORTRAIT

Added in [API level 34](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String PROPERTY_COMPAT_OVERRIDE_LANDSCAPE_TO_PORTRAIT
```

Application level `PackageManager
.Property` for an app to inform the system that the app can be opted-in or opted-out
from the compatibility treatment that rotates camera output by 90 degrees on landscape
sensors on devices known to have compatibility issues.

The treatment is disabled by default but device manufacturers can enable the treatment
using their discretion to improve camera compatibility. With this property set to
`false`, the rotation will not be applied. A value of `true`
will ensure that rotation is applied, provided it is enabled for the device. In most cases,
if rotation is the desired behavior this property need not be set. However, if your app
experiences stretching or incorrect rotation on these devices, explicitly setting this to
`true` may resolve that behavior. Apps should set this to `false` if there
is confidence that the app handles
`CameraCharacteristics.SENSOR_ORIENTATION` correctly.
See  [the
documentation for best practice.](https://developer.android.com/training/camera2/camera-preview)

**Syntax:**

```
<application>
  <property
    android:name="android.camera.PROPERTY_COMPAT_OVERRIDE_LANDSCAPE_TO_PORTRAIT"

Added in [API level 34](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String PROPERTY_SPECIAL_USE_FGS_SUBTYPE
```

<service> level `PackageManager.Property` tag specifying
the actual use case of the service if it's foreground service with the type
`ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_SPECIAL_USE`.

For example:
<service>
<property android:name="android.app.PROPERTY\_SPECIAL\_USE\_FGS\_SUBTYPE"
android:value="foo"/>
</service>

Constant Value:
"android.app.PROPERTY\_SPECIAL\_USE\_FGS\_SUBTYPE"

### PROPERTY\_USE\_RESTRICTED\_BACKUP\_MODE

Added in [API level 36](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String PROPERTY_USE_RESTRICTED_BACKUP_MODE
```

<application> level `PackageManager.Property` tag
specifying whether the app should be put into the "restricted" backup mode when it's started
for backup and restore operations.

See  [for
information about restricted mode](https://developer.android.com/identity/data/autobackup#ImplementingBackupAgent).

Starting with Android 16 apps may not be started in restricted mode based on this
property.

**Syntax:**

```
<application>
  <property
    android:name="android.app.backup.PROPERTY_USE_RESTRICTED_BACKUP_MODE"
    android:value="true|false"/>
</application>
```

If this property is set, the operating system will respect it for now (see Note below).
If it's not set, the behavior depends on the SDK level that the app is targeting. For apps
targeting SDK level `Build.VERSION_CODES.VANILLA_ICE_CREAM` or lower, the
property defaults to `true`. For apps targeting SDK level
`Build.VERSION_CODES.BAKLAVA` or higher, the operating system will make a
decision dynamically.

Note: It's not recommended to set this property to `true` unless absolutely
necessary. In a future Android version, this property may be deprecated in favor of removing
restricted mode completely.

Constant Value:
"android.app.backup.PROPERTY\_USE\_RESTRICTED\_BACKUP\_MODE"

`Context.getPackageManager`






## Public methods

### addPackageToPreferred

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
15](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public abstract void addPackageToPreferred (String packageName)
```

**This method was deprecated
in API level 15.**  
This function no longer does anything. It is the platform's
responsibility to assign preferred activities and this cannot be modified
directly. To determine the activities resolved by the platform, use
`resolveActivity(Intent, ResolveInfoFlags)` or `queryIntentActivities(Intent, ResolveInfoFlags)`. To configure
an app to be responsible for a particular role and to check current role
holders, see `RoleManager`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `packageName` | `String`: This value cannot be `null`. |

### addPermission

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public abstract boolean addPermission (PermissionInfo info)
```

Add a new dynamic permission to the system. For this to work, your
package must have defined a permission tree through the
`<permission-tree>` tag in its manifest. A package can only add
permissions to trees that were defined by either its own package or
another with the same user id; a permission is in a tree if it
matches the name of the permission tree + ".": for example,
"com.foo.bar" is a member of the permission tree "com.foo".

It is good to make your permission tree name descriptive, because you
are taking possession of that entire set of permission names. Thus, it
must be under a domain you control, with a suffix that will not match
any normal permissions that may be declared in any applications that
are part of that domain.

New permissions must be added before
any .apks are installed that use those permissions. Permissions you
add through this method are remembered across reboots of the device.
If the given permission already exists, the info you supply here
will be used to update it.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `info` | `PermissionInfo`: Description of the permission to be added.   This value cannot be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | Returns true if a new permission was created, false if an existing one was updated. |

| Throws | |
| --- | --- |
| `SecurityException` | if you are not allowed to add the given permission name. |

**See also:**

* `removePermission(String)`

### addPermissionAsync

Added in [API level 8](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public abstract boolean addPermissionAsync (PermissionInfo info)
```

Like `addPermission(PermissionInfo)` but asynchronously
persists the package manager state after returning from the call,
allowing it to return quicker and batch a series of adds at the
expense of no guarantee the added permission will be retained if
the device is rebooted before it is written.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `info` | `PermissionInfo`: This value cannot be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` |  |

### addPreferredActivity

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
15](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public abstract void addPreferredActivity (IntentFilter filter, 
                int match, 
                ComponentName[] set, 
                ComponentName activity)
```

**This method was deprecated
in API level 15.**  
This function no longer does anything. It is the platform's
responsibility to assign preferred activities and this cannot be modified
directly. To determine the activities resolved by the platform, use
`resolveActivity(Intent, ResolveInfoFlags)` or `queryIntentActivities(Intent, ResolveInfoFlags)`. To configure
an app to be responsible for a particular role and to check current role
holders, see `RoleManager`.

Add a new preferred activity mapping to the system. This will be used
to automatically select the given activity component when
`Context.startActivity()` finds
multiple matching activities and also matches the given filter.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `filter` | `IntentFilter`: The set of intents under which this activity will be made preferred.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `match` | `int`: The IntentFilter match category that this preference applies to. |
| `set` | `ComponentName`: The set of activities that the user was picking from when this preference was made.   This value may be `null`. |
| `activity` | `ComponentName`: The component name of the activity that is to be preferred.   This value cannot be `null`. |

### addWhitelistedRestrictedPermission

Added in [API level 29](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean addWhitelistedRestrictedPermission (String packageName, 
                String permName, 
                int whitelistFlags)
```

Adds a whitelisted restricted permission for an app.

Permissions can be hard restricted which means that the app cannot hold
them or soft restricted where the app can hold the permission but in a weaker
form. Whether a permission is `hard
restricted` or `soft restricted`
depends on the permission declaration. Whitelisting a hard restricted permission
allows for the to hold that permission and whitelisting a soft restricted
permission allows the app to hold the permission in its full, unrestricted form.

There are four whitelists:1. one for cases where the system permission policy whitelists a permission
   This list corresponds to the `FLAG_PERMISSION_WHITELIST_SYSTEM` flag.
   Can only be modified by pre-installed holders of a dedicated permission.
2. one for cases where the system whitelists the permission when upgrading
   from an OS version in which the permission was not restricted to an OS version
   in which the permission is restricted. This list corresponds to the `FLAG_PERMISSION_WHITELIST_UPGRADE` flag. Can be modified by pre-installed
   holders of a dedicated permission. The installer on record can only remove
   permissions from this whitelist.
3. one for cases where the installer of the package whitelists a permission.
   This list corresponds to the `FLAG_PERMISSION_WHITELIST_INSTALLER` flag.
   Can be modified by pre-installed holders of a dedicated permission or the installer
   on record.

You need to specify the whitelists for which to set the whitelisted permissions
which will clear the previous whitelisted permissions and replace them with the
provided ones.

**Note:** In retrospect it would have been preferred to use
more inclusive terminology when naming this API. Similar APIs added will
refrain from using the term "whitelist".

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `packageName` | `String`: The app for which to get whitelisted permissions.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `permName` | `String`: The whitelisted permission to add.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `whitelistFlags` | `int`: The whitelists to which to add. Passing multiple flags updates all specified whitelists.   Value is either `0` or a combination of the following:  * `FLAG_PERMISSION_WHITELIST_SYSTEM` * `FLAG_PERMISSION_WHITELIST_INSTALLER` * `FLAG_PERMISSION_WHITELIST_UPGRADE` |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | Whether the permission was added to the whitelist. |

| Throws | |
| --- | --- |
| `SecurityException` | if you try to modify a whitelist that you have no access to. |

**See also:**

* `getWhitelistedRestrictedPermissions(String,int)`
* `removeWhitelistedRestrictedPermission(String,String,int)`

```
public boolean canPackageQuery (String sourcePackageName, 
                String targetPackageName)
```

Returns `true` if the source package is able to query for details about the
target package. Applications that share details about other applications should
use this API to determine if those details should be withheld from callers that
do not otherwise have visibility of them.

Note: The caller must be able to query for details about the source and target
package. A `NameNotFoundException` is thrown if it isn't.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `sourcePackageName` | `String`: The source package that would receive details about the target package.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `targetPackageName` | `String`: The target package whose details would be shared with the source package.   This value cannot be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | `true` if the source package is able to query for details about the target package. |

| Throws | |
| --- | --- |
| `PackageManager.NameNotFoundException` | if either a given package can not be found on the system, or if the caller is not able to query for details about the source or target package. |

### canPackageQuery

Added in [API level 34](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean[] canPackageQuery (String sourcePackageName, 
                String[] targetPackageNames)
```

Same as `canPackageQuery(String,String)` but accepts an array of target packages to
be queried.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `sourcePackageName` | `String`: The source package that would receive details about the target package.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `targetPackageNames` | `String`: An array of target packages whose details would be shared with the source package.   This value cannot be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean[]` | An array of booleans where each member specifies whether the source package is able to query for details about the target package given by the corresponding value at the same index in the array of target packages.   This value cannot be `null`. |

| Throws | |
| --- | --- |
| `PackageManager.NameNotFoundException` | if either a given package can not be found on the system, or if the caller is not able to query for details about the source or target packages. |

### canRequestPackageInstalls

Added in [API level 26](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public abstract boolean canRequestPackageInstalls ()
```

Checks whether the calling package is allowed to request package installs through package
installer. Apps are encouraged to call this API before launching the package installer via
intent `Intent.ACTION_INSTALL_PACKAGE`. Starting from Android O, the
user can explicitly choose what external sources they trust to install apps on the device.
If this API returns false, the install request will be blocked by the package installer and
a dialog will be shown to the user with an option to launch settings to change their
preference. An application must target Android O or higher and declare permission
`Manifest.permission.REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES` in order to use this API.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | true if the calling package is trusted by the user to request install packages on the device, false otherwise. |

**See also:**

* `Intent.ACTION_INSTALL_PACKAGE`
* `Settings.ACTION_MANAGE_UNKNOWN_APP_SOURCES`

### canonicalToCurrentPackageNames

Added in [API level 8](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```

Map from a packages canonical name to the current name in use on the device.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `packageNames` | `String`: Array of new names to be mapped.   This value cannot be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `String[]` | Returns an array of the same size as the original, containing the current name for each package. |

### checkPermission

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public abstract int checkPermission (String permName, 
                String packageName)
```

Check whether a particular package has been granted a particular
permission.

**Note:** This API returns the underlying permission state
as-is and is mostly intended for permission managing system apps. To
perform an access check for a certain app, please use the
`Context.checkPermission` APIs instead.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `permName` | `String`: The name of the permission you are checking for.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `packageName` | `String`: The name of the package you are checking against.   This value cannot be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `int` | If the package has the permission, PERMISSION\_GRANTED is returned. If it does not have the permission, PERMISSION\_DENIED is returned.   Value is one of the following:  * `PERMISSION_GRANTED` * `PERMISSION_DENIED` |

**See also:**

* `PERMISSION_GRANTED`
* `PERMISSION_DENIED`

### checkSignatures

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public abstract int checkSignatures (String packageName1, 
                String packageName2)
```

Compare the signatures of two packages to determine if the same
signature appears in both of them. If they do contain the same
signature, then they are allowed special privileges when working
with each other: they can share the same user-id, run instrumentation
against each other, etc.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `packageName1` | `String`: First package name whose signature will be compared.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `packageName2` | `String`: Second package name whose signature will be compared.   This value cannot be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `int` | Returns an integer indicating whether all signatures on the two packages match. The value is >= 0 (`SIGNATURE_MATCH`) if all signatures match or < 0 if there is not a match (`SIGNATURE_NO_MATCH` or `SIGNATURE_UNKNOWN_PACKAGE`).   Value is one of the following:  * `SIGNATURE_MATCH` * `SIGNATURE_NEITHER_SIGNED` * `SIGNATURE_FIRST_NOT_SIGNED` * `SIGNATURE_SECOND_NOT_SIGNED` * `SIGNATURE_NO_MATCH` * `SIGNATURE_UNKNOWN_PACKAGE` |

**See also:**

* `checkSignatures(int, int)`

### checkSignatures

```
public abstract int checkSignatures (int uid1, 
                int uid2)
```

Like `checkSignatures(String,String)`, but takes UIDs of
the two packages to be checked. This can be useful, for example,
when doing the check in an IPC, where the UID is the only identity
available. It is functionally identical to determining the package
associated with the UIDs and checking their signatures.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `uid1` | `int`: First UID whose signature will be compared. |
| `uid2` | `int`: Second UID whose signature will be compared. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `int` | Returns an integer indicating whether all signatures on the two packages match. The value is >= 0 (`SIGNATURE_MATCH`) if all signatures match or < 0 if there is not a match (`SIGNATURE_NO_MATCH` or `SIGNATURE_UNKNOWN_PACKAGE`).   Value is one of the following:  * `SIGNATURE_MATCH` * `SIGNATURE_NEITHER_SIGNED` * `SIGNATURE_FIRST_NOT_SIGNED` * `SIGNATURE_SECOND_NOT_SIGNED` * `SIGNATURE_NO_MATCH` * `SIGNATURE_UNKNOWN_PACKAGE` |

**See also:**

* `checkSignatures(String,String)`

### clearInstantAppCookie

Added in [API level 26](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

* `getInstantAppCookieMaxBytes()`
* `getInstantAppCookie()`
* `clearInstantAppCookie()`

### clearPackagePreferredActivities

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
29](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public abstract void clearPackagePreferredActivities (String packageName)
```

**This method was deprecated
in API level 29.**  
This function no longer does anything. It is the platform's
responsibility to assign preferred activities and this cannot be modified
directly. To determine the activities resolved by the platform, use
`resolveActivity(Intent, ResolveInfoFlags)` or `queryIntentActivities(Intent, ResolveInfoFlags)`. To configure
an app to be responsible for a particular role and to check current role
holders, see `RoleManager`.

Remove all preferred activity mappings, previously added with
`addPreferredActivity(IntentFilter, int, ComponentName, ComponentName)`, from the
system whose activities are implemented in the given package name.
An application can only clear its own package(s).

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `packageName` | `String`: The name of the package whose preferred activity mappings are to be removed.   This value cannot be `null`. |

### currentToCanonicalPackageNames

Added in [API level 8](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public abstract String[] currentToCanonicalPackageNames (String[] packageNames)
```

Map from the current package names in use on the device to whatever
the current canonical name of that package is.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `packageNames` | `String`: Array of current names to be mapped.   This value cannot be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `String[]` | Returns an array of the same size as the original, containing the canonical name for each package. |

### extendVerificationTimeout

Added in [API level 17](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public abstract void extendVerificationTimeout (int id, 
                int verificationCodeAtTimeout, 
                long millisecondsToDelay)
```

Allows a package listening to the
`package verification
broadcast` to extend the default timeout for a response and declare what
action to perform after the timeout occurs. The response must include
the `verificationCodeAtTimeout` which is one of
`PackageManager.VERIFICATION_ALLOW` or
`PackageManager.VERIFICATION_REJECT`.
This method can be called multiple times, but the total amount of time extension time will
be limited to `PackageManager.MAXIMUM_VERIFICATION_TIMEOUT`. If the method is called
multiple times with different `verificationCodeAtTimeout`, then previous
`verificationCodeAtTimeout` will be ignored and only the latest one will take effect.
If this method is called after calling `PackageManager.verifyPendingInstall`, it may
nullify the result set by verifyPendingInstall.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | `int`: pending package identifier as passed via the `PackageManager.EXTRA_VERIFICATION_ID` Intent extra. |
| `verificationCodeAtTimeout` | `int`: either `PackageManager.VERIFICATION_ALLOW` or `PackageManager.VERIFICATION_REJECT`. If `verificationCodeAtTimeout` is neither `PackageManager.VERIFICATION_ALLOW` or `PackageManager.VERIFICATION_REJECT`, then `verificationCodeAtTimeout` will default to `PackageManager.VERIFICATION_REJECT`. |
| `millisecondsToDelay` | `long`: the amount of time requested for the timeout. Must be positive and less than `PackageManager.MAXIMUM_VERIFICATION_TIMEOUT`. If `millisecondsToDelay` is out of bounds, `millisecondsToDelay` will be set to the closest in bounds value; namely, 0 or `PackageManager.MAXIMUM_VERIFICATION_TIMEOUT`. |

| Throws | |
| --- | --- |
| `SecurityException` | if the caller does not have the PACKAGE\_VERIFICATION\_AGENT permission. |

### getActivityBanner

Added in [API level 20](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public abstract Drawable getActivityBanner (ComponentName activityName)
```

Retrieve the banner associated with an activity. Given the full name of
an activity, retrieves the information about it and calls
`ComponentInfo.loadIcon()` to return its
banner. If the activity cannot be found, NameNotFoundException is thrown.

The returned drawable is subject to the same size capping limits as described
in `getApplicationIcon(ApplicationInfo)`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `activityName` | `ComponentName`: Name of the activity whose banner is to be retrieved.   This value cannot be `null`. |

| Returns | |

public abstract Drawable getActivityBanner (Intent intent)
```

Retrieve the banner associated with an Intent. If intent.getClassName()
is set, this simply returns the result of
getActivityBanner(intent.getClassName()). Otherwise it resolves the
intent's component and returns the banner associated with the resolved
component. If intent.getClassName() cannot be found or the Intent cannot
be resolved to a component, NameNotFoundException is thrown.

### getActivityIcon

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public abstract Drawable getActivityIcon (Intent intent)
```

Retrieve the icon associated with an Intent. If intent.getClassName() is
set, this simply returns the result of
getActivityIcon(intent.getClassName()). Otherwise it resolves the intent's
component and returns the icon associated with the resolved component.
If intent.getClassName() cannot be found or the Intent cannot be resolved
to a component, NameNotFoundException is thrown.

### getEnableAppLockIntentForPackage

Added in [version 37.2](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/revisions)

```
public PendingIntent getEnableAppLockIntentForPackage (String packageName, 
                boolean enabled)
```

Returns a `PendingIntent` to launch an `Activity` that allows the caller to
set App Lock for the specified package. Returns null if the App Lock state of the package
cannot be set, either because App Lock is not supported for that package, or because it is
already set to that value.

App Lock is a feature that allows users to add authentication as a requirement to open
individual apps, even if the device is unlocked. When App Lock is enabled for an app, the
system performs the following protections:

* Requires authentication using device credentials (e.g. PIN, pattern, or password) or
  Class 3 biometrics, whenever the user attempts to open the app (including after
  reinstallation), or share information to it via the Sharesheet.
* Redacts sensitive content of notifications sent by the app.
* Removes the app's widgets and shortcuts from the home screen.
* Displays a locked view of the app in Recents to prevent content leakage.
* Hides the app's Direct Share targets from the Sharesheet.

Once authenticated, an App Lock enabled app remains unlocked while it is visible in
the foreground. The app will remain unlocked for a short grace period after the user
navigates away, after which the system will re-lock it. Additionally, all App Lock
enabled apps are immediately locked whenever the device is locked.

Before calling this API to avoid getting a null `PendingIntent` callers should
first verify that App Lock is supported for the specified package by first checking
`ApplicationInfo.isAppLockSupported`, or if it's already at the target state for that
package by checking `ApplicationInfo.isAppLockEnabled`. The `PendingIntent`
resolves to an activity, which allows the user to enroll a device credential if one isn't
enrolled, and then requires authentication before setting the App Lock enablement state as
enabled or disabled.
  
Requires `Manifest.permission.LOCK_APPS`

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `packageName` | `String`: the package to enable or disable App Lock.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `enabled` | `boolean`: true when the user would like to enable App Lock for the given package, false otherwise |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `PendingIntent` | a `PendingIntent` to launch an activity to set App Lock for the passed in package. If the package does not support App Lock or the package's App Lock state is already in the passed in state, return null. |

### getGroupOfPlatformPermission

Added in [API level 31](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

platform-defined permission.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `permissionName` | `String`: the permission whose group is desired.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `executor` | `Executor`: the `Executor` on which to invoke the callback.   This value cannot be `null`.   Callback and listener events are dispatched through this `Executor`, providing an easy way to control which thread is used. To dispatch events through the main thread of your application, you can use `Context.getMainExecutor()`. Otherwise, provide an `Executor` that dispatches to an appropriate thread. |
| `callback` | `Consumer`: the callback which will receive the name of the permission group this permission belongs to, or `null` if it has no group, is not a platform-defined permission, or there was an exception |

### getInstallSourceInfo

If the calling application does not hold the INSTALL\_PACKAGES permission then
the result will always return `null` from
`InstallSourceInfo.getOriginatingPackageName()`.

If the package that requested the install has been uninstalled, then information about it
will only be returned from `InstallSourceInfo.getInitiatingPackageName()` and
`InstallSourceInfo.getInitiatingPackageSigningInfo()` if the calling package is
requesting its own install information and is not an instant app.

```
public abstract Intent getLaunchIntentForPackage (String packageName)
```

Returns a "good" intent to launch a front-door activity in a package.
This is used, for example, to implement an "open" button when browsing
through packages. The current implementation looks first for a main
activity in the category `Intent.CATEGORY_INFO`, and next for a
main activity in the category `Intent.CATEGORY_LAUNCHER`. Returns
`null` if neither are found.

Consider using `getLaunchIntentSenderForPackage(String)` if
the caller is not allowed to query for the `packageName`.

package. This is used, for example, to implement an "open" button when browsing through
packages. The current implementation is the same with
`getLaunchIntentForPackage(String)`. Instead of returning the `Intent`, it
returns the `IntentSender` which is not restricted by the package visibility.

The caller can invoke
`IntentSender.sendIntent(Context,int,Intent,IntentSender.OnFinished,Handler)`
to launch the activity. An `IntentSender.SendIntentException` is thrown if the
package does not contain such an activity, or if *packageName* is not recognized.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `packageName` | `String`: The name of the package to inspect.   This value cannot be `null`. |

                Rect badgeLocation, 
                int badgeDensity)
```

If the target user is a managed profile of the calling user or the caller
is itself a managed profile, then this returns a badged copy of the given
drawable allowing the user to distinguish it from the original drawable.
The caller can specify the location in the bounds of the drawable to be
badged where the badge should be applied as well as the density of the
badge to be used.

If the original drawable is a BitmapDrawable and the backing bitmap is
mutable as per `Bitmap.isMutable()`, the badging
is performed in place and the original drawable is returned.

| `badgeDensity` | `int`: The optional desired density for the badge as per `DisplayMetrics.densityDpi`. If it's not positive, the density of the display is used. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Drawable` | A drawable that combines the original drawable and a badge as determined by the system.   This value cannot be `null`. |

### getUserBadgedIcon

Added in [API level 21](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public abstract Drawable getUserBadgedIcon (Drawable drawable, 
                UserHandle user)
```

If the target user is a managed profile, then this returns a badged copy of the given icon
to be able to distinguish it from the original icon. For badging an arbitrary drawable use
`getUserBadgedDrawableForDensity(android.graphics.drawable.Drawable,UserHandle,android.graphics.Rect,int)`.

If the original drawable is a BitmapDrawable and the backing bitmap is
mutable as per `Bitmap.isMutable()`, the badging
is performed in place and the original drawable is returned.

```

If the target user is a managed profile of the calling user or the caller
is itself a managed profile, then this returns a copy of the label with
badging for accessibility services like talkback. E.g. passing in "Email"
and it might return "Work Email" for Email in the work profile.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `label` | `CharSequence`: The label to change.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `user` | `UserHandle`: The target user.   This value cannot be `null`. |

```

Verifies and returns the
[app signing](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/apksigning)
information of the file at the given path. This operation takes a few milliseconds.
Unlike `getPackageArchiveInfo(String,PackageInfoFlags)` with `GET_SIGNING_CERTIFICATES`, this method does not require the file to be a package archive
file.

### getWhitelistedRestrictedPermissions

Added in [API level 29](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Set<String> getWhitelistedRestrictedPermissions (String packageName, 
                int whitelistFlag)
```

Gets the restricted permissions that have been whitelisted and the app
is allowed to have them granted in their full form.

Permissions can be hard restricted which means that the app cannot hold
them or soft restricted where the app can hold the permission but in a weaker
form. Whether a permission is `hard
restricted` or `soft restricted`
depends on the permission declaration. Whitelisting a hard restricted permission
allows for the to hold that permission and whitelisting a soft restricted
permission allows the app to hold the permission in its full, unrestricted form.

There are four allowlists:1. one for cases where the system permission policy whitelists a permission
   This list corresponds to the`FLAG_PERMISSION_WHITELIST_SYSTEM` flag.
   Can only be accessed by pre-installed holders of a dedicated permission.
2. one for cases where the system whitelists the permission when upgrading
   from an OS version in which the permission was not restricted to an OS version
   in which the permission is restricted. This list corresponds to the `FLAG_PERMISSION_WHITELIST_UPGRADE` flag. Can be accessed by pre-installed
   holders of a dedicated permission or the installer on record.
3. one for cases where the installer of the package whitelists a permission.
   This list corresponds to the `FLAG_PERMISSION_WHITELIST_INSTALLER` flag.
   Can be accessed by pre-installed holders of a dedicated permission or the
   installer on record.

**Note:** In retrospect it would have been preferred to use
more inclusive terminology when naming this API. Similar APIs added will
refrain from using the term "whitelist".

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `packageName` | `String`: The app for which to get whitelisted permissions.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `whitelistFlag` | `int`: The flag to determine which whitelist to query. Only one flag can be passed.s.   Value is either `0` or a combination of the following:  * `FLAG_PERMISSION_WHITELIST_SYSTEM` * `FLAG_PERMISSION_WHITELIST_INSTALLER` * `FLAG_PERMISSION_WHITELIST_UPGRADE` |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Set<String>` | The whitelisted permissions that are on any of the whitelists you query for.   This value cannot be `null`. |

| Throws | |
| --- | --- |
| `SecurityException` | if you try to access a whitelist that you have no access to. |

```
public abstract XmlResourceParser getXml (String packageName, 
                int resid, 
                ApplicationInfo appInfo)
```

Retrieve an XML file from a package. This is a low-level API used to
retrieve XML meta data.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `packageName` | `String`: The name of the package that this xml is coming from. Cannot be null. |
| `resid` | `int`: The resource identifier of the desired xml. Cannot be 0. |
| `appInfo` | `ApplicationInfo`: Overall information about packageName. This may be null, in which case the application information will be retrieved for you if needed; if you already have this information around, it can be much more efficient to supply it here. |

### hasSigningCertificate

Added in [API level 28](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean hasSigningCertificate (int uid, 
                byte[] certificate, 
                int type)
```

Searches the set of signing certificates by which the package(s) for the given uid has proven
to have been signed. For multiple packages sharing the same uid, this will return the
signing certificates found in the signing history of the "newest" package, where "newest"
indicates the package with the newest signing certificate in the shared uid group. This
method should be used instead of `getPackageInfo` with `GET_SIGNATURES`
since it takes into account the possibility of signing certificate rotation, except in the
case of packages that are signed by multiple certificates, for which signing certificate
rotation is not supported. This method is analogous to using `getPackagesForUid`
followed by `getPackageInfo` with `GET_SIGNING_CERTIFICATES`, selecting the
`PackageInfo` of the newest-signed bpackage , and finally searching through the
resulting `signingInfo` field to see if the desired certificate is there.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `uid` | `int`: uid whose signing certificates to check |
| `certificate` | `byte`: signing certificate for which to search.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `type` | `int`: representation of the `certificate`   Value is one of the following:  * `CERT_INPUT_RAW_X509` * `CERT_INPUT_SHA256` |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | true if this package was or is signed by exactly the certificate `certificate` |

### hasSigningCertificate

                int type)
```

Searches the set of signing certificates by which the given package has proven to have been
signed. This should be used instead of `getPackageInfo` with `GET_SIGNATURES`
since it takes into account the possibility of signing certificate rotation, except in the
case of packages that are signed by multiple certificates, for which signing certificate
rotation is not supported. This method is analogous to using `getPackageInfo` with
`GET_SIGNING_CERTIFICATES` and then searching through the resulting `signingInfo` field to see if the desired certificate is present.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `packageName` | `String`: package whose signing certificates to check.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `certificate` | `byte`: signing certificate for which to search.   This value cannot be `null`. |

when the app is unused for an extended period of time.
Only the installer on record that installed the given package, or a holder of
`WHITELIST_AUTO_REVOKE_PERMISSIONS` is allowed to call this.

**Note:** In retrospect it would have been preferred to use
more inclusive terminology when naming this API. Similar APIs added will
refrain from using the term "whitelist".

### isPackageSuspended

Added in [API level 28](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean isPackageSuspended ()
```

Apps can query this to know if they have been suspended. A system app with the permission
`android.permission.SUSPEND_APPS` can put any app on the device into a suspended state.

While in this state, the application's notifications will be hidden, any of its started
activities will be stopped and it will not be able to show toasts or dialogs or play audio.
When the user tries to launch a suspended app, the system will, instead, show a
dialog to the user informing them that they cannot use this app while it is suspended.

When an app is put into this state, the broadcast action
`Intent.ACTION_MY_PACKAGE_SUSPENDED` will be delivered to any of its broadcast
receivers that included this action in their intent-filters, *including manifest
receivers.* Similarly, a broadcast action `Intent.ACTION_MY_PACKAGE_UNSUSPENDED`
is delivered when a previously suspended app is taken out of this state. Apps are expected to
use these to gracefully deal with transitions to and from this state.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | `true` if the calling package has been suspended, `false` otherwise. |

**See also:**

* `getSuspendedPackageAppExtras()`
* `Intent.ACTION_MY_PACKAGE_SUSPENDED`
* `Intent.ACTION_MY_PACKAGE_UNSUSPENDED`

```
public abstract boolean isPermissionRevokedByPolicy (String permName, 
                String packageName)
```

Checks whether a particular permissions has been revoked for a
package by policy. Typically the device owner or the profile owner
may apply such a policy. The user cannot grant policy revoked
permissions, hence the only way for an app to get such a permission
is by a policy change.

| Parameters | |

            xmlResourceParser -> {
                Bundle bundle = new Bundle();
                // Search the start tag
                int type;
                while ((type = xmlResourceParser.next()) != XmlPullParser.START_TAG
                        && type != XmlPullParser.END_DOCUMENT) {
                }
                if (type != XmlPullParser.START_TAG) {
                    return bundle;
                }

                // Start to read the tags and attributes from the xmlResourceParser
                if (!xmlResourceParser.getName().equals("manifest")) {
                    return bundle;
                }
                String packageName = xmlResourceParser.getAttributeValue(null, "package");
                bundle.putString("package", packageName);

                return bundle;
            });
} catch (IOException e) {
}
```

Note: When the parserFunction is invoked, the client can read the AndroidManifest.xml
information by the XmlResourceParser object. After leaving the parserFunction, the
XmlResourceParser object will be closed. The caller should also handle the exception for
calling this method.
  
This method may take several seconds to complete, so it should
only be called from a worker thread.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `apkFile` | `File`: The file of an application apk.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `parserFunction` | `Function`: The parserFunction will be invoked with the XmlResourceParser object after getting the AndroidManifest.xml of an application package.   This value cannot be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `T` | Returns the result of the `Function.apply(Object)`. |

| Throws | |
| --- | --- |
| `IOException` | if the AndroidManifest.xml of an application package cannot be read or accessed. |

### removePackageFromPreferred

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
15](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public abstract void removePackageFromPreferred (String packageName)
```

**This method was deprecated
in API level 15.**  
This function no longer does anything. It is the platform's
responsibility to assign preferred activities and this cannot be modified
directly. To determine the activities resolved by the platform, use
`resolveActivity(Intent, ResolveInfoFlags)` or `queryIntentActivities(Intent, ResolveInfoFlags)`. To configure
an app to be responsible for a particular role and to check current role
holders, see `RoleManager`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `packageName` | `String`: This value cannot be `null`. |

### removePermission

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public abstract void removePermission (String permName)
```

`addPermission(PermissionInfo)`. The same ownership rules apply
-- you are only allowed to remove permissions that you are allowed
to add.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `permName` | `String`: The name of the permission to remove.   This value cannot be `null`. |

| Throws | |
| --- | --- |
| `SecurityException` | if you are not allowed to remove the given permission name. |

### removeWhitelistedRestrictedPermission

Added in [API level 29](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean removeWhitelistedRestrictedPermission (String packageName, 
                String permName, 
                int whitelistFlags)
```

Removes a whitelisted restricted permission for an app.

Permissions can be hard restricted which means that the app cannot hold
them or soft restricted where the app can hold the permission but in a weaker
form. Whether a permission is `hard
restricted` or `soft restricted`
depends on the permission declaration. Whitelisting a hard restricted permission
allows for the to hold that permission and whitelisting a soft restricted
permission allows the app to hold the permission in its full, unrestricted form.

There are four whitelists:1. one for cases where the system permission policy whitelists a permission
   This list corresponds to the `FLAG_PERMISSION_WHITELIST_SYSTEM` flag.
   Can only be modified by pre-installed holders of a dedicated permission.
2. one for cases where the system whitelists the permission when upgrading
   from an OS version in which the permission was not restricted to an OS version
   in which the permission is restricted. This list corresponds to the `FLAG_PERMISSION_WHITELIST_UPGRADE` flag. Can be modified by pre-installed
   holders of a dedicated permission. The installer on record can only remove
   permissions from this whitelist.
3. one for cases where the installer of the package whitelists a permission.
   This list corresponds to the `FLAG_PERMISSION_WHITELIST_INSTALLER` flag.
   Can be modified by pre-installed holders of a dedicated permission or the installer
   on record.
4. one for cases where the system exempts the permission when upgrading
   from an OS version in which the permission was not restricted to an OS version
   in which the permission is restricted. This list corresponds to the `FLAG_PERMISSION_WHITELIST_UPGRADE` flag. Can be modified by pre-installed
   holders of a dedicated permission. The installer on record can only remove
   permissions from this allowlist.

You need to specify the whitelists for which to set the whitelisted permissions
which will clear the previous whitelisted permissions and replace them with the
provided ones.

**Note:** In retrospect it would have been preferred to use
more inclusive terminology when naming this API. Similar APIs added will
refrain from using the term "whitelist".

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `packageName` | `String`: The app for which to get whitelisted permissions.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `permName` | `String`: The whitelisted permission to remove.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `whitelistFlags` | `int`: The whitelists from which to remove. Passing multiple flags updates all specified whitelists.   Value is either `0` or a combination of the following:  * `FLAG_PERMISSION_WHITELIST_SYSTEM` * `FLAG_PERMISSION_WHITELIST_INSTALLER` * `FLAG_PERMISSION_WHITELIST_UPGRADE` |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | Whether the permission was removed from the whitelist. |

| Throws | |
| --- | --- |
| `SecurityException` | if you try to modify a whitelist that you have no access to. |

### requestChecksums

Added in [API level 31](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void requestChecksums (String packageName, 
                boolean includeSplits, 
                int required, 
                List<Certificate> trustedInstallers, 
                PackageManager.OnChecksumsReadyListener onChecksumsReadyListener)
```

Requests the checksums for APKs within a package.
The checksums will be returned asynchronously via onChecksumsReadyListener.
By default returns all readily available checksums:
- enforced by platform,
- enforced by installer.
If caller needs a specific checksum kind, they can specify it as required.
**Caution: Android can not verify installer-provided checksums. Make sure you specify
trusted installers.**

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `packageName` | `String`: whose checksums to return.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `includeSplits` | `boolean`: whether to include checksums for non-base splits. |
| `required` | `int`: explicitly request the checksum types. May incur significant CPU/memory/disk usage.   Value is either `0` or a combination of the following:  * `Checksum.TYPE_WHOLE_MERKLE_ROOT_4K_SHA256` * `Checksum.TYPE_WHOLE_MD5` * `Checksum.TYPE_WHOLE_SHA1` * `Checksum.TYPE_WHOLE_SHA256` * `Checksum.TYPE_WHOLE_SHA512` * `Checksum.TYPE_PARTIAL_MERKLE_ROOT_1M_SHA256` * `Checksum.TYPE_PARTIAL_MERKLE_ROOT_1M_SHA512` |
| `trustedInstallers` | `List`: for checksums enforced by installer, which installers are to be trusted. `TRUST_ALL` will return checksums from any installer, `TRUST_NONE` disables optimized installer-enforced checksums, otherwise the list has to be non-empty list of certificates.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `onChecksumsReadyListener` | `PackageManager.OnChecksumsReadyListener`: called once when the results are available.   This value cannot be `null`. |

| Throws | |
| --- | --- |
| `PackageManager.NameNotFoundException` | if a package with the given name cannot be found on the system. |
| `IllegalArgumentException` | if the list of trusted installer certificates is empty. |
| `CertificateEncodingException` | if an encoding error occurs for trustedInstallers. |

### resolveActivity

Added in [API level 33](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public ResolveInfo resolveActivity (Intent intent, 
                PackageManager.ResolveInfoFlags flags)
```

See `resolveActivity(Intent,int)`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `intent` | `Intent`: This value cannot be `null`. |
| `flags` | `PackageManager.ResolveInfoFlags`: This value cannot be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `ResolveInfo` | This value may be `null`. |

### resolveActivity

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public abstract ResolveInfo resolveActivity (Intent intent, 
                int flags)
```

Determine the best action to perform for a given Intent. This is how
`Intent.resolveActivity` finds an activity if a class has not been
explicitly specified.

*Note:* if using an implicit Intent (without an explicit
ComponentName specified), be sure to consider whether to set the
`MATCH_DEFAULT_ONLY` only flag. You need to do so to resolve the
activity in the same way that
`android.content.Context.startActivity(Intent)` and
`Intent.resolveActivity(PackageManager)` do.

Use `resolveActivity(Intent,ResolveInfoFlags)` when long flags are needed.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `intent` | `Intent`: An intent containing all of the desired specification (action, data, type, category, and/or component).   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `flags` | `int`: Additional option flags to modify the data returned. The most important is `MATCH_DEFAULT_ONLY`, to limit the resolution to only those activities that support the `Intent.CATEGORY_DEFAULT`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `ResolveInfo` | Returns a ResolveInfo object containing the final activity intent that was determined to be the best action. Returns null if no matching activity was found. If multiple matching activities are found and there is no default set, returns a ResolveInfo object containing something else, such as the activity resolver. |

```

Use `resolveContentProvider(String,ComponentInfoFlags)` when long flags are needed.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `authority` | `String`: The authority of the provider to find.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `flags` | `int`: Additional option flags to modify the data returned. |

                int newState, 
                int flags)
```

Set the enabled setting for an application
This setting will override any enabled state which may have been set by the application in
its manifest. It also overrides the enabled state set in the manifest for any of the
application's components. It does not override any enabled state set by
`setComponentEnabledSetting(ComponentName, int, int)` for any of the application's components.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `packageName` | `String`: The package name of the application to enable.   This value cannot be `null`. |

### setAutoRevokeWhitelisted

Added in [API level 30](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean setAutoRevokeWhitelisted (String packageName, 
                boolean whitelisted)
```

Marks an application exempt from having its permissions be automatically revoked when
the app is unused for an extended period of time.
Only the installer on record that installed the given package is allowed to call this.
Packages start in whitelisted state, and it is the installer's responsibility to
un-whitelist the packages it installs, unless auto-revoking permissions from that package
would cause breakages beyond having to re-request the permission(s).

**Note:** In retrospect it would have been preferred to use
more inclusive terminology when naming this API. Similar APIs added will
refrain from using the term "whitelist".

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `packageName` | `String`: The app for which to set exemption.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `whitelisted` | `boolean`: Whether the app should be whitelisted. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | whether any change took effect. |

| Throws | |
| --- | --- |
| `SecurityException` | if you you have no access to modify this. |

**See also:**

* `isAutoRevokeWhitelisted()`

### setComponentEnabledSetting

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public abstract void setComponentEnabledSetting (ComponentName componentName, 
                int newState, 
                int flags)
```

Set the enabled setting for a package component (activity, receiver, service, provider).
This setting will override any enabled state which may have been set by the component in its
manifest.

Consider using `setComponentEnabledSettings(List)` if multiple components need to
be updated atomically.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `componentName` | `ComponentName`: The component to enable.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `newState` | `int`: The new enabled state for the component.   Value is one of the following:  * `COMPONENT_ENABLED_STATE_DEFAULT` * `COMPONENT_ENABLED_STATE_ENABLED` * `COMPONENT_ENABLED_STATE_DISABLED` * `COMPONENT_ENABLED_STATE_DISABLED_USER` * `COMPONENT_ENABLED_STATE_DISABLED_UNTIL_USED` |
| `flags` | `int`: Optional behavior flags.   Value is either `0` or a combination of the following:  * `DONT_KILL_APP` * `SYNCHRONOUS` |

### setComponentEnabledSettings

Added in [API level 33](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void setComponentEnabledSettings (List<PackageManager.ComponentEnabledSetting> settings)
```

Set the enabled settings for package components such as activities, receivers, services and
providers. This setting will override any enabled state which may have been set by the
component in its manifest.

This api accepts a list of component changes, and applies them all atomically. The
application can use this api if components have dependencies and need to be updated
atomically.

The permission is not required if target components are running under the same uid with
the caller.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `settings` | `List`: The list of component enabled settings to update. Note that an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown if the duplicated component name is in the list or there's a conflict `DONT_KILL_APP` flag between different components in the same package.   This value cannot be `null`. |

**See also:**

* `setComponentEnabledSetting(ComponentName,int,int)`

### setInstallerPackageName

Added in [API level 11](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public abstract void setInstallerPackageName (String targetPackage, 
                String installerPackageName)
```

Change the installer associated with a given package. There are limitations
on how the installer package can be changed; in particular:

* A SecurityException will be thrown if installerPackageName
  is not signed with the same certificate as the calling application.
* A SecurityException will be thrown if targetPackage already
  has an installer package, and that installer package is not signed with
  the same certificate as the calling application.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `targetPackage` | `String`: The installed package whose installer will be changed.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `installerPackageName` | `String`: The package name of the new installer. May be null to clear the association. |

### setMimeGroup

Added in [API level 30](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void setMimeGroup (String mimeGroup, 
                Set<String> mimeTypes)
```

Sets MIME group's MIME types.
Libraries should use a reverse-DNS prefix followed by a ':' character and library-specific
group name to avoid namespace collisions, e.g. "com.example:myFeature".

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `mimeGroup` | `String`: MIME group to modify.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `mimeTypes` | `Set`: new MIME types contained by MIME group.   This value cannot be `null`. |

### updateInstantAppCookie

Added in [API level 26](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public abstract void updateInstantAppCookie (byte[] cookie)
```

Updates the instant application cookie for the calling app. Non
instant apps and apps that were instant but were upgraded
to normal apps can still access this API. For instant apps
this cookie is cached for some time after uninstall while for
normal apps the cookie is deleted after the app is uninstalled.
The cookie is always present while the app is installed. The
cookie size is limited by `getInstantAppCookieMaxBytes()`.
Passing `null` or an empty array clears the cookie.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `cookie` | `byte`: The cookie data.   This value may be `null`. |

| Throws | |
| --- | --- |
| `IllegalArgumentException` | if the array exceeds max cookie size. |

```
public abstract void verifyPendingInstall (int id, 
                int verificationCode)
```

Allows a package listening to the
`package verification
broadcast` to respond to the package manager. The response must include
the `verificationCode` which is one of
`PackageManager.VERIFICATION_ALLOW` or
`PackageManager.VERIFICATION_REJECT`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | `int`: pending package identifier as passed via the `PackageManager.EXTRA_VERIFICATION_ID` Intent extra. |
| `verificationCode` | `int`: either `PackageManager.VERIFICATION_ALLOW` or `PackageManager.VERIFICATION_REJECT`. |

| Throws | |
| --- | --- |
| `SecurityException` | if the caller does not have the PACKAGE\_VERIFICATION\_AGENT permission. |
