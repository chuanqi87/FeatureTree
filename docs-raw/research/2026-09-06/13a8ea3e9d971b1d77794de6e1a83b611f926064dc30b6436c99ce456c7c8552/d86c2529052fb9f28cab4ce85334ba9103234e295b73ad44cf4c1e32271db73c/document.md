An intent is an abstract description of an operation to be performed. It
can be used with `startActivity` to
launch an `Activity`,
`broadcastIntent` to
send it to any interested `BroadcastReceiver` components,
and `Context.startService(Intent)` or
`Context.bindService(Intent, BindServiceFlags, Executor, ServiceConnection)` to communicate with a
background `Service`.

An Intent provides a facility for performing late runtime binding between the code in
different applications. Its most significant use is in the launching of activities, where it
can be thought of as the glue between activities. It is basically a passive data structure
holding an abstract description of an action to be performed.

### Developer Guides

For information about how to create and resolve intents, read the
[Intents and Intent Filters](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/intents/intents-filters)
developer guide.



### Intent Structure

The primary pieces of information in an intent are:

* **action** -- The general action to be performed, such as
  `ACTION_VIEW`, `ACTION_EDIT`, `ACTION_MAIN`,
  etc.
* **data** -- The data to operate on, such as a person record
  in the contacts database, expressed as a `Uri`.

Some examples of action/data pairs are:

* **`ACTION_VIEW` *content://contacts/people/1*** -- Display
  information about the person whose identifier is "1".
* **`ACTION_DIAL` *content://contacts/people/1*** -- Display
  the phone dialer with the person filled in.
* **`ACTION_VIEW` *tel:123*** -- Display
  the phone dialer with the given number filled in. Note how the
  VIEW action does what is considered the most reasonable thing for
  a particular URI.
* **`ACTION_DIAL` *tel:123*** -- Display
  the phone dialer with the given number filled in.
* **`ACTION_EDIT` *content://contacts/people/1*** -- Edit
  information about the person whose identifier is "1".
* **`ACTION_VIEW` *content://contacts/people/*** -- Display
  a list of people, which the user can browse through. This example is a
  typical top-level entry into the Contacts application, showing you the
  list of people. Selecting a particular person to view would result in a
  new intent { **`ACTION_VIEW` *content://contacts/people/N*** }
  being used to start an activity to display that person.

In addition to these primary attributes, there are a number of secondary
attributes that you can also include with an intent:

* **category** -- Gives additional information about the action
  to execute. For example, `CATEGORY_LAUNCHER` means it should
  appear in the Launcher as a top-level application, while
  `CATEGORY_ALTERNATIVE` means it should be included in a list
  of alternative actions the user can perform on a piece of data.

  * **type** -- Specifies an explicit type (a MIME type) of the
    intent data. Normally the type is inferred from the data itself.
    By setting this attribute, you disable that evaluation and force
    an explicit type.

    * **component** -- Specifies an explicit name of a component
      class to use for the intent. Normally this is determined by looking
      at the other information in the intent (the action, data/type, and
      categories) and matching that with a component that can handle it.
      If this attribute is set then none of the evaluation is performed,
      and this component is used exactly as is. By specifying this attribute,
      all of the other Intent attributes become optional.

      * **extras** -- This is a `Bundle` of any additional information.
        This can be used to provide extended information to the component.
        For example, if we have a action to send an e-mail message, we could
        also include extra pieces of data here to supply a subject, body,
        etc.

Here are some examples of other operations you can specify as intents
using these additional parameters:

* **`ACTION_MAIN` with category `CATEGORY_HOME`** --
  Launch the home screen.
* **`ACTION_GET_CONTENT` with MIME type
  *`vnd.android.cursor.item/phone`***
  -- Display the list of people's phone numbers, allowing the user to
  browse through them and pick one and return it to the parent activity.
* **`ACTION_GET_CONTENT` with MIME type
  *\*/\** and category `CATEGORY_OPENABLE`**
  -- Display all pickers for data that can be opened with
  `ContentResolver.openInputStream()`,
  allowing the user to pick one of them and then some data inside of it
  and returning the resulting URI to the caller. This can be used,
  for example, in an e-mail application to allow the user to pick some
  data to include as an attachment.

There are a variety of standard Intent action and category constants
defined in the Intent class, but applications can also define their own.
These strings use Java-style scoping, to ensure they are unique -- for
example, the standard `ACTION_VIEW` is called
"android.intent.action.VIEW".

Put together, the set of actions, data types, categories, and extra data
defines a language for the system allowing for the expression of phrases
such as "call john smith's cell". As applications are added to the system,
they can extend this language by adding new actions, types, and categories, or
they can modify the behavior of existing phrases by supplying their own
activities that handle them.



### Intent Resolution

There are two primary forms of intents you will use.

* **Explicit Intents** have specified a component (via
  `setComponent(ComponentName)` or `setClass(Context, Class)`), which provides the exact
  class to be run. Often these will not include any other information,
  simply being a way for an application to launch various internal
  activities it has as the user interacts with the application.* **Implicit Intents** have not specified a component;
    instead, they must include enough information for the system to
    determine which of the available components is best to run for that
    intent.

When using implicit intents, given such an arbitrary intent we need to
know what to do with it. This is handled by the process of *Intent
resolution*, which maps an Intent to an `Activity`,
`BroadcastReceiver`, or `Service` (or sometimes two or
more activities/receivers) that can handle it.

The intent resolution mechanism basically revolves around matching an
Intent against all of the <intent-filter> descriptions in the
installed application packages. (Plus, in the case of broadcasts, any `BroadcastReceiver`
objects explicitly registered with `Context.registerReceiver`.) More
details on this can be found in the documentation on the `IntentFilter` class.

There are three pieces of information in the Intent that are used for
resolution: the action, type, and category. Using this information, a query
is done on the `PackageManager` for a component that can handle the
intent. The appropriate component is determined based on the intent
information supplied in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file as
follows:

* The **action**, if given, must be listed by the component as
  one it handles.

  * The **type** is retrieved from the Intent's data, if not
    already supplied in the Intent. Like the action, if a type is
    included in the intent (either explicitly or implicitly in its
    data), then this must be listed by the component as one it handles.

    * For data that is not a `content:` URI and where no explicit
      type is included in the Intent, instead the **scheme** of the
      intent data (such as `http:` or `mailto:`) is
      considered. Again like the action, if we are matching a scheme it
      must be listed by the component as one it can handle.* The **categories**, if supplied, must *all* be listed
        by the activity as categories it handles. That is, if you include
        the categories `CATEGORY_LAUNCHER` and
        `CATEGORY_ALTERNATIVE`, then you will only resolve to components
        with an intent that lists *both* of those categories.
        Activities will very often need to support the
        `CATEGORY_DEFAULT` so that they can be found by
        `Context.startActivity()`.

For example, consider the Note Pad sample application that
allows a user to browse through a list of notes data and view details about
individual items. Text in italics indicates places where you would replace a
name with one specific to your own package.

        </activity>

        <activity class=".TitleEditor" android:label="@string/title_edit_title"
                android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Dialog">
            <intent-filter android:label="@string/resolve_title">
                <action android:name="com.android.notepad.action.EDIT_TITLE" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.ALTERNATIVE" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.SELECTED_ALTERNATIVE" />
                <data android:mimeType="vnd.android.cursor.item/vnd.google.note" />
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>

    </application>
</manifest>
```

The first activity,
`com.android.notepad.NotesList`, serves as our main
entry into the app. It can do three things as described by its three intent
templates:

1. ```
   <intent-filter>
       <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
       <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
   </intent-filter>
   ```

   This provides a top-level entry into the NotePad application: the standard
   MAIN action is a main entry point (not requiring any other information in
   the Intent), and the LAUNCHER category says that this entry point should be
   listed in the application launcher.

   - ```
     <intent-filter>
         <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
         <action android:name="android.intent.action.EDIT" />
         <action android:name="android.intent.action.PICK" />
         <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
         <data android:mimeType="vnd.android.cursor.dir/vnd.google.note" />
     </intent-filter>
     ```

     This declares the things that the activity can do on a directory of
     notes. The type being supported is given with the <type> tag, where
     `vnd.android.cursor.dir/vnd.google.note` is a URI from which
     a Cursor of zero or more items (`vnd.android.cursor.dir`) can
     be retrieved which holds our note pad data (`vnd.google.note`).
     The activity allows the user to view or edit the directory of data (via
     the VIEW and EDIT actions), or to pick a particular note and return it
     to the caller (via the PICK action). Note also the DEFAULT category
     supplied here: this is *required* for the
     `Context.startActivity` method to resolve your
     activity when its component name is not explicitly specified.

     - ```
       <intent-filter>
           <action android:name="android.intent.action.GET_CONTENT" />
           <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
           <data android:mimeType="vnd.android.cursor.item/vnd.google.note" />
       </intent-filter>
       ```

       This filter describes the ability to return to the caller a note selected by
       the user without needing to know where it came from. The data type
       `vnd.android.cursor.item/vnd.google.note` is a URI from which
       a Cursor of exactly one (`vnd.android.cursor.item`) item can
       be retrieved which contains our note pad data (`vnd.google.note`).
       The GET\_CONTENT action is similar to the PICK action, where the activity
       will return to its caller a piece of data selected by the user. Here,
       however, the caller specifies the type of data they desire instead of
       the type of data the user will be picking from.

Given these capabilities, the following intents will resolve to the
NotesList activity:

* **{ action=android.app.action.MAIN }** matches all of the
  activities that can be used as top-level entry points into an
  application.

  * **{ action=android.app.action.MAIN,
    category=android.app.category.LAUNCHER }** is the actual intent
    used by the Launcher to populate its top-level list.

    * **{ action=android.intent.action.VIEW
      data=content://com.google.provider.NotePad/notes }**
      displays a list of all the notes under
      "content://com.google.provider.NotePad/notes", which
      the user can browse through and see the details on.

      * **{ action=android.app.action.PICK
        data=content://com.google.provider.NotePad/notes }**
        provides a list of the notes under
        "content://com.google.provider.NotePad/notes", from which
        the user can pick a note whose data URL is returned back to the caller.

        * **{ action=android.app.action.GET\_CONTENT
          type=vnd.android.cursor.item/vnd.google.note }**
          is similar to the pick action, but allows the caller to specify the
          kind of data they want back so that the system can find the appropriate
          activity to pick something of that data type.

The second activity,
`com.android.notepad.NoteEditor`, shows the user a single
note entry and allows them to edit it. It can do two things as described
by its two intent templates:

1. ```
   <intent-filter android:label="@string/resolve_edit">
       <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
       <action android:name="android.intent.action.EDIT" />
       <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
       <data android:mimeType="vnd.android.cursor.item/vnd.google.note" />
   </intent-filter>
   ```

   The first, primary, purpose of this activity is to let the user interact
   with a single note, as decribed by the MIME type
   `vnd.android.cursor.item/vnd.google.note`. The activity can
   either VIEW a note or allow the user to EDIT it. Again we support the
   DEFAULT category to allow the activity to be launched without explicitly
   specifying its component.

   - ```
     <intent-filter>
         <action android:name="android.intent.action.INSERT" />
         <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
         <data android:mimeType="vnd.android.cursor.dir/vnd.google.note" />
     </intent-filter>
     ```

     The secondary use of this activity is to insert a new note entry into
     an existing directory of notes. This is used when the user creates a new
     note: the INSERT action is executed on the directory of notes, causing
     this activity to run and have the user create the new note data which
     it then adds to the content provider.

Given these capabilities, the following intents will resolve to the
NoteEditor activity:

* **{ action=android.intent.action.VIEW
  data=content://com.google.provider.NotePad/notes/{ID} }**
  shows the user the content of note {ID}.

  * **{ action=android.app.action.EDIT
    data=content://com.google.provider.NotePad/notes/{ID} }**
    allows the user to edit the content of note {ID}.

    * **{ action=android.app.action.INSERT
      data=content://com.google.provider.NotePad/notes }**
      creates a new, empty note in the notes list at
      "content://com.google.provider.NotePad/notes"
      and allows the user to edit it. If they keep their changes, the URI
      of the newly created note is returned to the caller.

The last activity,
`com.android.notepad.TitleEditor`, allows the user to
edit the title of a note. This could be implemented as a class that the
application directly invokes (by explicitly setting its component in
the Intent), but here we show a way you can publish alternative
operations on existing data:

```
<intent-filter android:label="@string/resolve_title">
    <action android:name="com.android.notepad.action.EDIT_TITLE" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.ALTERNATIVE" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.SELECTED_ALTERNATIVE" />
    <data android:mimeType="vnd.android.cursor.item/vnd.google.note" />
</intent-filter>
```

In the single intent template here, we
have created our own private action called
`com.android.notepad.action.EDIT_TITLE` which means to
edit the title of a note. It must be invoked on a specific note
(data type `vnd.android.cursor.item/vnd.google.note`) like the previous
view and edit actions, but here displays and edits the title contained
in the note data.

In addition to supporting the default category as usual, our title editor
also supports two other standard categories: ALTERNATIVE and
SELECTED\_ALTERNATIVE. Implementing
these categories allows others to find the special action it provides
without directly knowing about it, through the
`PackageManager.queryIntentActivityOptions(ComponentName, Intent, Intent, int)` method, or
more often to build dynamic menu items with
`Menu.addIntentOptions(int, int, int, ComponentName, Intent, Intent, int, MenuItem)`. Note that in the intent
template here was also supply an explicit name for the template
(via `android:label="@string/resolve_title"`) to better control
what the user sees when presented with this activity as an alternative
action to the data they are viewing.

Given these capabilities, the following intent will resolve to the
TitleEditor activity:

* **{ action=com.android.notepad.action.EDIT\_TITLE
  data=content://com.google.provider.NotePad/notes/{ID} }**
  displays and allows the user to edit the title associated
  with note {ID}.

### Standard Activity Actions

These are the current standard actions that Intent defines for launching
activities (usually through `Context.startActivity`. The most
important, and by far most frequently used, are `ACTION_MAIN` and
`ACTION_EDIT`.

* `ACTION_MAIN`* `ACTION_VIEW`* `ACTION_ATTACH_DATA`* `ACTION_EDIT`* `ACTION_PICK`* `ACTION_CHOOSER`* `ACTION_GET_CONTENT`* `ACTION_DIAL`* `ACTION_CALL`* `ACTION_SEND`* `ACTION_SENDTO`* `ACTION_ANSWER`* `ACTION_INSERT`* `ACTION_DELETE`* `ACTION_RUN`* `ACTION_SYNC`* `ACTION_PICK_ACTIVITY`* `ACTION_SEARCH`* `ACTION_WEB_SEARCH`* `ACTION_FACTORY_TEST`

### Standard Broadcast Actions

These are the current standard actions that Intent defines for receiving
broadcasts (usually through `Context.registerReceiver` or a
<receiver> tag in a manifest).

* `ACTION_TIME_TICK`* `ACTION_TIME_CHANGED`* `ACTION_TIMEZONE_CHANGED`* `ACTION_TIMEZONE_OFFSET_CHANGED`* `ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED`* `ACTION_PACKAGE_ADDED`* `ACTION_PACKAGE_CHANGED`* `ACTION_PACKAGE_REMOVED`* `ACTION_PACKAGE_RESTARTED`* `ACTION_PACKAGE_DATA_CLEARED`* `ACTION_PACKAGES_SUSPENDED`* `ACTION_PACKAGES_UNSUSPENDED`* `ACTION_UID_REMOVED`* `ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED`* `ACTION_POWER_CONNECTED`* `ACTION_POWER_DISCONNECTED`* `ACTION_SHUTDOWN`

**Note:** If your app targets Android 11
(API level 30) or higher, registering broadcast such as
`ACTION_PACKAGES_SUSPENDED` that includes package details in the
extras receives a filtered list of apps or nothing. Learn more about how to
[manage package visibility](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/intents/package-visibility).

### Standard Categories

These are the current standard categories that can be used to further
clarify an Intent via `addCategory(String)`.

* `CATEGORY_DEFAULT`* `CATEGORY_BROWSABLE`* `CATEGORY_TAB`* `CATEGORY_ALTERNATIVE`* `CATEGORY_SELECTED_ALTERNATIVE`* `CATEGORY_LAUNCHER`* `CATEGORY_INFO`* `CATEGORY_HOME`* `CATEGORY_PREFERENCE`* `CATEGORY_TEST`* `CATEGORY_CAR_DOCK`* `CATEGORY_DESK_DOCK`* `CATEGORY_LE_DESK_DOCK`* `CATEGORY_HE_DESK_DOCK`* `CATEGORY_CAR_MODE`* `CATEGORY_APP_MARKET`* `CATEGORY_VR_HOME`

### Standard Extra Data

These are the current standard fields that can be used as extra data via
`putExtra(String, Bundle)`.

* `EXTRA_ALARM_COUNT`* `EXTRA_BCC`* `EXTRA_CC`* `EXTRA_CHANGED_COMPONENT_NAME`* `EXTRA_DATA_REMOVED`* `EXTRA_DOCK_STATE`* `EXTRA_DOCK_STATE_HE_DESK`* `EXTRA_DOCK_STATE_LE_DESK`* `EXTRA_DOCK_STATE_CAR`* `EXTRA_DOCK_STATE_DESK`* `EXTRA_DOCK_STATE_UNDOCKED`* `EXTRA_DONT_KILL_APP`* `EXTRA_EMAIL`* `EXTRA_INITIAL_INTENTS`* `EXTRA_INTENT`* `EXTRA_KEY_EVENT`* `EXTRA_ORIGINATING_URI`* `EXTRA_PHONE_NUMBER`* `EXTRA_REFERRER`* `EXTRA_REMOTE_INTENT_TOKEN`* `EXTRA_REPLACING`* `EXTRA_SHORTCUT_ICON`* `EXTRA_SHORTCUT_ICON_RESOURCE`* `EXTRA_SHORTCUT_INTENT`* `EXTRA_STREAM`* `EXTRA_SHORTCUT_NAME`* `EXTRA_SUBJECT`* `EXTRA_TEMPLATE`* `EXTRA_TEXT`* `EXTRA_TITLE`* `EXTRA_UID`* `EXTRA_USER_INITIATED`

### Flags

These are the possible flags that can be used in the Intent via
`setFlags(int)` and `addFlags(int)`. See `setFlags(int)` for a list
of all possible flags.

charging state, level, and other information about the battery.
See `BatteryManager` for documentation on the
contents of the Intent.

You *cannot* receive this through components declared
in manifests, only by explicitly registering for it with
`Context.registerReceiver()`. See `ACTION_BATTERY_LOW`,
`ACTION_BATTERY_OKAY`, `ACTION_POWER_CONNECTED`,
and `ACTION_POWER_DISCONNECTED` for distinct battery-related
broadcasts that are sent and can be received through manifest
receivers.

This is a protected intent that can only be sent
by the system.

Constant Value:
"android.intent.action.BATTERY\_CHANGED"

### ACTION\_BATTERY\_LOW

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String ACTION_BATTERY_LOW
```

Broadcast Action: Indicates low battery condition on the device.
This broadcast corresponds to the "Low battery warning" system dialog.

This is a protected intent that can only be sent
by the system.

Constant Value:
"android.intent.action.BATTERY\_LOW"

This is a protected intent that can only be sent
by the system.

Constant Value:
"android.intent.action.BATTERY\_OKAY"

### ACTION\_BOOT\_COMPLETED

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED
```

Broadcast Action: This is broadcast once, after the user has finished
booting. It can be used to perform application-specific initialization,
such as installing alarms. You must hold the
`Manifest.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` permission in
order to receive this broadcast.

This broadcast is sent at boot by all devices (both with and without
direct boot support). Upon receipt of this broadcast, the user is
unlocked and both device-protected and credential-protected storage can
accessed safely.

If you need to run while the user is still locked (before they've entered
their lock pattern or PIN for the first time), you can listen for the
`ACTION_LOCKED_BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast.

Starting from Android `Build.VERSION_CODES.VANILLA_ICE_CREAM`, this broadcast is
not only sent after the device boots but also delivered to an app when it is
removed from the `Stopped` state and the user is
unlocked, such as the first launch after force-stopping the app.
This is a protected intent that can only be sent by the system.

Constant Value:
"android.intent.action.BOOT\_COMPLETED"

### ACTION\_BUG\_REPORT

### ACTION\_CALL

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String ACTION_CALL
```

Activity Action: Perform a call to someone specified by the data.

Input: If nothing, an empty dialer is started; else `getData()`
is URI of a phone number to be dialed or a tel: URI of an explicit phone
number.

Output: nothing.

Note: there will be restrictions on which applications can initiate a
call; most applications should use the `ACTION_DIAL`.

Note: this Intent **cannot** be used to call emergency
numbers. Applications can **dial** emergency numbers using
`ACTION_DIAL`, however.

Note: This Intent can only be used to dial call forwarding MMI codes if the application
using this intent is set as the default or system dialer. The system will treat any other
application using this Intent for the purpose of dialing call forwarding MMI codes as if the
`ACTION_DIAL` Intent was used instead.

Note: An app filling the `RoleManager.ROLE_DIALER` role should use
`android.telecom.TelecomManager.placeCall(Uri,Bundle)` to place calls rather than
relying on this intent.

Note: If your app targets `M`
or higher and declares as using the `Manifest.permission.CALL_PHONE`
permission which is not granted, then attempting to use this action will
result in a `SecurityException`.

Constant Value:
"android.intent.action.CALL"

### ACTION\_CALL\_BUTTON

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String ACTION_CALL_BUTTON
```

Activity Action: The user pressed the "call" button to go to the dialer
or other appropriate UI for placing a call.

Input: Nothing.

Output: Nothing.

Constant Value:
"android.intent.action.CALL\_BUTTON"

### ACTION\_CAMERA\_BUTTON

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String ACTION_CAMERA_BUTTON
```

Broadcast Action: The "Camera Button" was pressed. Includes a single
extra field, `EXTRA_KEY_EVENT`, containing the key event that
caused the broadcast.

Constant Value:
"android.intent.action.CAMERA\_BUTTON"

### ACTION\_CARRIER\_SETUP

Added in [API level 26](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String ACTION_CARRIER_SETUP
```

Activity Action: Main entry point for carrier setup apps.

Carrier apps that provide an implementation for this action may be invoked to configure
carrier service and typically require
`carrier privileges` to
fulfill their duties.

Constant Value:
"android.intent.action.CARRIER\_SETUP"

### ACTION\_CHOOSER

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String ACTION_CHOOSER
```

Activity Action: Display an activity chooser, allowing the user to pick
what they want to before proceeding. This can be used as an alternative
to the standard activity picker that is displayed by the system when
you try to start an activity with multiple possible matches, with these
differences in behavior:

* You can specify the title that will appear in the activity chooser.* The user does not have the option to make one of the matching
    activities a preferred activity, and all possible activities will
    always be shown even if one of them is currently marked as the
    preferred activity.

This action should be used when the user will naturally expect to
select an activity in order to proceed. An example if when not to use
it is when the user clicks on a "mailto:" link. They would naturally
expect to go directly to their mail app, so startActivity() should be
called directly: it will
either launch the current preferred app, or put up a dialog allowing the
user to pick an app to use and optionally marking that as preferred.

In contrast, if the user is selecting a menu item to send a picture
they are viewing to someone else, there are many different things they
may want to do at this point: send it through e-mail, upload it to a
web service, etc. In this case the CHOOSER action should be used, to
always present to the user a list of the things they can do, with a
nice title given by the caller such as "Send this photo with:".

If you need to grant URI permissions through a chooser, you must specify
the permissions to be granted on the ACTION\_CHOOSER Intent
*in addition* to the EXTRA\_INTENT inside. This means using
`setClipData(ClipData)` to specify the URIs to be granted as well as
`FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION` and/or
`FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION` as appropriate.

As a convenience, an Intent of this form can be created with the
`createChooser(Intent, CharSequence)` function.

Input: No data should be specified. get\*Extra must have
a `EXTRA_INTENT` field containing the Intent being executed,
and can optionally have a `EXTRA_TITLE` field containing the
title text to display in the chooser.

Output: Depends on the protocol of `EXTRA_INTENT`.

Constant Value:
"android.intent.action.CHOOSER"

### ACTION\_CLOSE\_SYSTEM\_DIALOGS

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
31](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String ACTION_CLOSE_SYSTEM_DIALOGS
```

**This constant was deprecated
in API level 31.**  
This intent is deprecated for third-party applications starting from Android
`Build.VERSION_CODES.S` for security reasons. Unauthorized usage by applications
will result in the broadcast intent being dropped for apps targeting API level less than
`Build.VERSION_CODES.S` and in a `SecurityException` for apps targeting SDK
level `Build.VERSION_CODES.S` or higher. Instrumentation initiated from the shell
(eg. tests) is still able to use the intent. The platform will automatically collapse
the proper system dialogs in the proper use-cases. For all others, the user is the one in
control of closing dialogs.

Broadcast Action: This is broadcast when a user action should request a
temporary system dialog to dismiss. Some examples of temporary system
dialogs are the notification window-shade and the recent tasks dialog.
  
Requires android.Manifest.permission.BROADCAST\_CLOSE\_SYSTEM\_DIALOGS

**See also:**

* `AccessibilityService.GLOBAL_ACTION_DISMISS_NOTIFICATION_SHADE`

Constant Value:
"android.intent.action.CLOSE\_SYSTEM\_DIALOGS"

### ACTION\_CONFIGURATION\_CHANGED

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String ACTION_CONFIGURATION_CHANGED
```

Broadcast Action: The current device `Configuration`
(orientation, locale, etc) has changed. When such a change happens, the
UIs (view hierarchy) will need to be rebuilt based on this new
information; for the most part, applications don't need to worry about
this, because the system will take care of stopping and restarting the
application to make sure it sees the new changes. Some system code that
can not be restarted will need to watch for this action and handle it
appropriately.

You *cannot* receive this through components declared
in manifests, only by explicitly registering for it with
`Context.registerReceiver()`.

This is a protected intent that can only be sent
by the system.

**See also:**

* `Configuration`

Constant Value:
"android.intent.action.CONFIGURATION\_CHANGED"

### ACTION\_CREATE\_DOCUMENT

Added in [API level 19](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT
```

Activity Action: Allow the user to create a new document. When invoked,
the system will display the various `DocumentsProvider` instances
installed on the device, letting the user navigate through them. The
returned document may be a newly created document with no content, or it
may be an existing document with the requested MIME type.

Each document is represented as a `content://` URI backed by a
`DocumentsProvider`, which can be opened as a stream with
`ContentResolver.openFileDescriptor(Uri,String)`, or queried for
`DocumentsContract.Document` metadata.

Callers must indicate the concrete MIME type of the document being
created by setting `setType(String)`. This MIME type cannot be
changed after the document is created.

Callers can provide an initial display name through `EXTRA_TITLE`,
but the user may change this value before creating the file.

Callers must include `CATEGORY_OPENABLE` in the Intent to obtain
URIs that can be opened with
`ContentResolver.openFileDescriptor(Uri,String)`.

Callers can set a document URI through
`DocumentsContract.EXTRA_INITIAL_URI` to indicate the initial
location of documents navigator. System will do its best to launch the
navigator in the specified document if it's a folder, or the folder that
contains the specified document if not.

Output: The URI of the item that was created. This must be a
`content://` URI so that any receiver can access it.

**See also:**

* `DocumentsContract`
* `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT`
* `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE`
* `FLAG_GRANT_PERSISTABLE_URI_PERMISSION`

Constant Value:
"android.intent.action.CREATE\_DOCUMENT"

### ACTION\_CREATE\_NOTE

Added in [API level 34](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String ACTION_CREATE_NOTE
```

Activity Action: Starts a note-taking activity that can be used to create a note. This action
can be used to start an activity on the lock screen. Activity should ensure to appropriately

Input: nothing

Output: nothing

Constant Value:
"android.intent.action.FACTORY\_TEST"

### ACTION\_GET\_CONTENT

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String ACTION_GET_CONTENT
```

Activity Action: Allow the user to select a particular kind of data and
return it. This is different than `ACTION_PICK` in that here we
just say what kind of data is desired, not a URI of existing data from
which the user can pick. An ACTION\_GET\_CONTENT could allow the user to
create the data as it runs (for example taking a picture or recording a
sound), let them browse over the web and download the desired data,
etc.

There are two main ways to use this action: if you want a specific kind
of data, such as a person contact, you set the MIME type to the kind of
data you want and launch it with `Context.startActivity(Intent)`.
The system will then launch the best application to select that kind
of data for you.

You may also be interested in any of a set of types of content the user
can pick. For example, an e-mail application that wants to allow the
user to add an attachment to an e-mail message can use this action to
bring up a list of all of the types of content the user can attach.

In this case, you should wrap the GET\_CONTENT intent with a chooser
(through `createChooser(Intent, CharSequence)`), which will give the proper interface
for the user to pick how to send your data and allow you to specify
a prompt indicating what they are doing. You will usually specify a
broad MIME type (such as image/\* or \*/\*), resulting in a
broad range of content types the user can select from.

When using such a broad GET\_CONTENT action, it is often desirable to
only pick from data that can be represented as a stream. This is
accomplished by requiring the `CATEGORY_OPENABLE` in the Intent.

Callers can optionally specify `EXTRA_LOCAL_ONLY` to request that
the launched content chooser only returns results representing data that
is locally available on the device. For example, if this extra is set
to true then an image picker should not show any pictures that are available
from a remote server but not already on the local device (thus requiring
they be downloaded when opened).

If the caller can handle multiple returned items (the user performing
multiple selection), then it can specify `EXTRA_ALLOW_MULTIPLE`
to indicate this.

Input: `getType()` is the desired MIME type to retrieve. Note
that no URI is supplied in the intent, as there are no constraints on
where the returned data originally comes from. You may also include the
`CATEGORY_OPENABLE` if you can only accept data that can be
opened as a stream. You may use `EXTRA_LOCAL_ONLY` to limit content
selection to local data. You may use `EXTRA_ALLOW_MULTIPLE` to
allow the user to select multiple items.

Output: The URI of the item that was picked. This must be a content:
URI so that any receiver can access it.

Constant Value:
"android.intent.action.GET\_CONTENT"

### ACTION\_GET\_RESTRICTION\_ENTRIES

Added in [API level 18](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String ACTION_GET_RESTRICTION_ENTRIES
```

Broadcast to a specific application to query any supported restrictions to impose
on restricted users. The broadcast intent contains an extra
`EXTRA_RESTRICTIONS_BUNDLE` with the currently persisted
restrictions as a Bundle of key/value pairs. The value types can be Boolean, String or
String[] depending on the restriction type.The response should contain an extra `EXTRA_RESTRICTIONS_LIST`,
which is of type `ArrayList<RestrictionEntry>`. It can also
contain an extra `EXTRA_RESTRICTIONS_INTENT`, which is of type `Intent`.
The activity specified by that intent will be launched for a result which must contain
one of the extras `EXTRA_RESTRICTIONS_LIST` or `EXTRA_RESTRICTIONS_BUNDLE`.
The keys and values of the returned restrictions will be persisted.

```

Activity Action: Activity to handle split installation failures.

Splits may be installed dynamically. This happens when an Activity is launched,
but the split that contains the application isn't installed. When a split is
installed in this manner, the containing package usually doesn't know this is
happening. However, if an error occurs during installation, the containing
package can define a single activity handling this action to deal with such
failures.

The activity handling this action must be in the base package.

current user that is already installed for another user. You can optionally supply
`EXTRA_INSTALLER_PACKAGE_NAME`, `EXTRA_NOT_UNKNOWN_SOURCE`,
`EXTRA_ALLOW_REPLACE`, and `EXTRA_RETURN_RESULT`.

Output: If `EXTRA_RETURN_RESULT`, returns whether the install
succeeded.

**Note:**If your app is targeting API level higher than 25 you
need to hold `Manifest.permission.REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES`
in order to launch the application installer.

### ACTION\_LAUNCH\_CAPTURE\_CONTENT\_ACTIVITY\_FOR\_NOTE

Added in [API level 34](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String ACTION_LAUNCH_CAPTURE_CONTENT_ACTIVITY_FOR_NOTE
```

Activity Action: Use with startActivityForResult to start a system activity that captures
content on the screen to take a screenshot and present it to the user for editing. The
edited screenshot is saved on device and returned to the calling activity as a `Uri`
through `getData()`. User interaction is required to return the edited screenshot to
the calling activity.

The response `Intent` may include additional data to "backlink" directly back to the
application for which the screenshot was captured. If present, the application "backlink" can
be retrieved via `getClipData()`. The data is present only if the user accepted to
include the link information with the screenshot. The data can contain one of the following:

* A deeplinking `Uri` or an `Intent` if the captured app integrates with
  `AssistContent`.
* Otherwise, a main launcher intent that launches the screenshotted application to
  its home screen.

The "backlink" to the screenshotted application will be set within `ClipData`, either
as a `Uri` or an `Intent` if present.

This intent action requires the permission
`Manifest.permission.LAUNCH_CAPTURE_CONTENT_ACTIVITY_FOR_NOTE`.

Callers should query
`StatusBarManager.canLaunchCaptureContentActivityForNote(Activity)` before showing a UI
element that allows users to trigger this flow.

Callers should query for `EXTRA_CAPTURE_CONTENT_FOR_NOTE_STATUS_CODE` in the
response `Intent` to check if the request was a success.
  
Requires `Manifest.permission.LAUNCH_CAPTURE_CONTENT_ACTIVITY_FOR_NOTE`

Constant Value:
"android.intent.action.LAUNCH\_CAPTURE\_CONTENT\_ACTIVITY\_FOR\_NOTE"

### ACTION\_LOCALE\_CHANGED

booting, but while still in the "locked" state. It can be used to perform
application-specific initialization, such as installing alarms. You must
hold the `Manifest.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`
permission in order to receive this broadcast.

This broadcast is sent immediately at boot by all devices (regardless of
direct boot support) running `Build.VERSION_CODES.N` or
higher. Upon receipt of this broadcast, the user is still locked and only
device-protected storage can be accessed safely. If you want to access
credential-protected storage, you need to wait for the user to be
unlocked (typically by entering their lock pattern or PIN for the first
time), after which the `ACTION_USER_UNLOCKED` and
`ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcasts are sent.

To receive this broadcast, your receiver component must be marked as
being `ComponentInfo.directBootAware`.

Starting from Android `Build.VERSION_CODES.VANILLA_ICE_CREAM`, this broadcast is
not only sent after the device boots but also delivered to an app when it is
removed from the `Stopped` state, such as the first
launch after force-stopping the app.

Added in [API level 28](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String ACTION_MY_PACKAGE_UNSUSPENDED
```

Broadcast Action: Sent to a package that has been unsuspended.

This is a protected intent that can only be sent
by the system. *This will be delivered to `BroadcastReceiver` components declared in
the manifest.*

**See also:**

* `ACTION_MY_PACKAGE_SUSPENDED`
* `EXTRA_SUSPENDED_PACKAGE_EXTRAS`
* `PackageManager.isPackageSuspended()`
* `PackageManager.getSuspendedPackageAppExtras()`

Constant Value:
"android.intent.action.MY\_PACKAGE\_UNSUSPENDED"

### ACTION\_NEW\_OUTGOING\_CALL

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
29](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String ACTION_NEW_OUTGOING_CALL
```

**This constant was deprecated
in API level 29.**  
Apps that redirect outgoing calls should use the
`CallRedirectionService` API. Apps that perform call screening
should use the `CallScreeningService` API. Apps which need to be
notified of basic call state should use
`TelephonyCallback.CallStateListener` to determine when a new
outgoing call is placed.

Broadcast Action: An outgoing call is about to be placed.

The Intent will have the following extra value:

* *`EXTRA_PHONE_NUMBER`* -
  the phone number dialed.

Starting in Android 15, this broadcast is no longer sent as an ordered
broadcast. The `resultData` no longer has any effect and will not determine the
actual routing of the call. Further, receivers of this broadcast do not get foreground
priority and cannot launch background activities.

Once the broadcast is finished, the resultData is used as the actual
number to call. If `null`, no call will be placed.

It is perfectly acceptable for multiple receivers to process the
outgoing call in turn: for example, a parental control application
might verify that the user is authorized to place the call at that
time, then a number-rewriting application might add an area code if
one was not specified.

For consistency, any receiver whose purpose is to prohibit phone
calls should have a priority of 0, to ensure it will see the final
phone number to be dialed.
Any receiver whose purpose is to rewrite phone numbers to be called
should have a positive priority.
Negative priorities are reserved for the system for this broadcast;
using them may cause problems.

Any BroadcastReceiver receiving this Intent *must not*
abort the broadcast.

Emergency calls cannot be intercepted using this mechanism, and
other calls cannot be modified to call emergency numbers using this
mechanism.

Some apps (such as VoIP apps) may want to redirect the outgoing
call to use their own service instead. Those apps should first prevent
the call from being placed by setting resultData to `null`
and then start their own app to make the call.

You must hold the
`Manifest.permission.PROCESS_OUTGOING_CALLS`
permission to receive this Intent.

Starting in `Build.VERSION_CODES.VANILLA_ICE_CREAM`, this broadcast is
no longer sent as an ordered broadcast, and does not allow activity launches. This means
that receivers may no longer change the phone number for the outgoing call, or cancel the
outgoing call. This functionality is only possible using the
`CallRedirectionService` API. Although background receivers are
woken up to handle this intent, no guarantee is made as to the timeliness of the broadcast.

This is a protected intent that can only be sent
by the system.

If the user has chosen a `CallRedirectionService` to
handle redirection of outgoing calls, this intent will NOT be sent as an ordered broadcast.
This means that attempts to re-write the outgoing call by other apps using this intent will
be ignored.

Constant Value:
"android.intent.action.NEW\_OUTGOING\_CALL"

### ACTION\_OPEN\_DOCUMENT

Added in [API level 19](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT
```

Activity Action: Allow the user to select and return one or more existing
documents. When invoked, the system will display the various
`DocumentsProvider` instances installed on the device, letting the
user interactively navigate through them. These documents include local
media, such as photos and video, and documents provided by installed
cloud storage providers.

Each document is represented as a `content://` URI backed by a
`DocumentsProvider`, which can be opened as a stream with
`ContentResolver.openFileDescriptor(Uri,String)`, or queried for
`DocumentsContract.Document` metadata.

All selected documents are returned to the calling application with
persistable read and write permission grants. If you want to maintain
access to the documents across device reboots, you need to explicitly
take the persistable permissions using
`ContentResolver.takePersistableUriPermission(Uri,int)`.

Callers must indicate the acceptable document MIME types through
`setType(String)`. For example, to select photos, use
`image/*`. If multiple disjoint MIME types are acceptable, define
them in `EXTRA_MIME_TYPES` and `setType(String)` to
\*/\*.

If the caller can handle multiple returned items (the user performing
multiple selection), then you can specify `EXTRA_ALLOW_MULTIPLE`
to indicate this.

Callers must include `CATEGORY_OPENABLE` in the Intent to obtain
URIs that can be opened with
`ContentResolver.openFileDescriptor(Uri,String)`.

Callers can set a document URI through
`DocumentsContract.EXTRA_INITIAL_URI` to indicate the initial
location of documents navigator. System will do its best to launch the
navigator in the specified document if it's a folder, or the folder that
contains the specified document if not.

Output: The URI of the item that was picked, returned in
`getData()`. This must be a `content://` URI so that any
receiver can access it. If multiple documents were selected, they are
returned in `getClipData()`.

**See also:**

* `DocumentsContract`
* `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE`
* `ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT`
* `FLAG_GRANT_PERSISTABLE_URI_PERMISSION`

Constant Value:
"android.intent.action.OPEN\_DOCUMENT"

### ACTION\_OPEN\_DOCUMENT\_TREE

Added in [API level 21](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE
```

Activity Action: Allow the user to pick a directory subtree. When
invoked, the system will display the various `DocumentsProvider`
instances installed on the device, letting the user navigate through
them. Apps can fully manage documents within the returned directory.

To gain access to descendant (child, grandchild, etc) documents, use
`DocumentsContract.buildDocumentUriUsingTree(Uri,String)` and
`DocumentsContract.buildChildDocumentsUriUsingTree(Uri,String)`
with the returned URI.

Callers can set a document URI through
`DocumentsContract.EXTRA_INITIAL_URI` to indicate the initial
location of documents navigator. System will do its best to launch the
navigator in the specified document if it's a folder, or the folder that
contains the specified document if not.

Output: The URI representing the selected directory tree.

**See also:**

* `DocumentsContract`

Constant Value:
"android.intent.action.OPEN\_DOCUMENT\_TREE"

### ACTION\_PROVIDER\_CHANGED

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String ACTION_PROVIDER_CHANGED
```

Broadcast Action: Some content providers have parts of their namespace
where they publish new events or items that the user may be especially
interested in. For these things, they may broadcast this action when the
set of interesting items change.
For example, GmailProvider sends this notification when the set of unread
mail in the inbox changes.

The data of the intent identifies which part of which provider
changed. When queried through the content resolver, the data URI will
return the data set in question.

The intent will have the following extra values:

* *count* - The number of items in the data set. This is the
  same as the number of items in the cursor returned by querying the
  data URI.

This intent will be sent at boot (if the count is non-zero) and when the
data set changes. It is possible for the data set to change without the
count changing (for example, if a new unread message arrives in the same
sync operation in which a message is archived). The phone should still
ring/vibrate/etc as normal in this case.

Constant Value:
"android.intent.action.PROVIDER\_CHANGED"

a URI or a list of URIs.

Activities handling this intent action should handle the vast majority of
MIME types rather than only specific ones.

Quick viewers must render the quick view image locally, and must not send
file content outside current device.

Input: `getData()` is a mandatory content URI of the item to
preview. `getClipData()` contains an optional list of content URIs
if there is more than one item to preview. `EXTRA_INDEX` is an
optional index of the URI in the clip data to show first.
`EXTRA_QUICK_VIEW_FEATURES` is an optional extra indicating the features
that can be shown in the quick view UI.

### ACTION\_SCREEN\_OFF

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String ACTION_SCREEN_OFF
```

Broadcast Action: Sent when the device goes to sleep and becomes non-interactive.

For historical reasons, the name of this broadcast action refers to the power
state of the screen but it is actually sent in response to changes in the
overall interactive state of the device.

This broadcast is sent when the device becomes non-interactive which may have
nothing to do with the screen turning off. To determine the
actual state of the screen, use `Display.getState()`.

See `PowerManager.isInteractive()` for details.

You *cannot* receive this through components declared in
manifests, only by explicitly registering for it with
`Context.registerReceiver()`.

This is a protected intent that can only be sent
by the system.

Constant Value:
"android.intent.action.SCREEN\_OFF"

### ACTION\_SCREEN\_ON

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String ACTION_SCREEN_ON
```

Broadcast Action: Sent when the device wakes up and becomes interactive.

For historical reasons, the name of this broadcast action refers to the power
state of the screen but it is actually sent in response to changes in the
overall interactive state of the device.

This broadcast is sent when the device becomes interactive which may have
nothing to do with the screen turning on. To determine the
actual state of the screen, use `Display.getState()`.

See `PowerManager.isInteractive()` for details.

You *cannot* receive this through components declared in
manifests, only by explicitly registering for it with
`Context.registerReceiver()`.

This is a protected intent that can only be sent
by the system.

Constant Value:
"android.intent.action.SCREEN\_ON"

### ACTION\_SEARCH

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String ACTION_SEARCH
```

Activity Action: Perform a search.

Input: `getStringExtra(SearchManager.QUERY)`
is the text to search for. If empty, simply
enter your search results Activity with the search UI activated.

Output: nothing.

Constant Value:
"android.intent.action.SEARCH"

### ACTION\_SEARCH\_LONG\_PRESS

Added in [API level 3](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String ACTION_SEARCH_LONG_PRESS
```

Activity Action: Start action associated with long pressing on the
search key.

Input: Nothing.

Output: Nothing.

Constant Value:
"android.intent.action.SEARCH\_LONG\_PRESS"

### ACTION\_SEND

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String ACTION_SEND
```

Activity Action: Deliver some data to someone else. Who the data is
being delivered to is not specified; it is up to the receiver of this
action to ask the user where the data should be sent.

When launching a SEND intent, you should usually wrap it in a chooser
(through `createChooser(Intent, CharSequence)`), which will give the proper interface
for the user to pick how to send your data and allow you to specify
a prompt indicating what they are doing.

Input: `getType()` is the MIME type of the data being sent.
get\*Extra can have either a `EXTRA_TEXT`
or `EXTRA_STREAM` field, containing the data to be sent. If
using EXTRA\_TEXT, the MIME type should be "text/plain"; otherwise it
should be the MIME type of the data in EXTRA\_STREAM. Use \*/\*
if the MIME type is unknown (this will only allow senders that can
handle generic data streams). If using `EXTRA_TEXT`, you can
also optionally supply `EXTRA_HTML_TEXT` for clients to retrieve
your text with HTML formatting.

As of `Build.VERSION_CODES.JELLY_BEAN`, the data
being sent can be supplied through `setClipData(ClipData)`. This
allows you to use `FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION` when sharing
content: URIs and other advanced features of `ClipData`. If
using this approach, you still must supply the same data through the
`EXTRA_TEXT` or `EXTRA_STREAM` fields described below
for compatibility with old applications. If you don't set a ClipData,
it will be copied there for you when calling `Context.startActivity(Intent)`.

Starting from `Build.VERSION_CODES.O`, if
`CATEGORY_TYPED_OPENABLE` is passed, then the Uris passed in
either `EXTRA_STREAM` or via `setClipData(ClipData)` may
be openable only as asset typed files using
`ContentResolver.openTypedAssetFileDescriptor(Uri,String,Bundle)`.

Optional standard extras, which may be interpreted by some recipients as
appropriate, are: `EXTRA_EMAIL`, `EXTRA_CC`,
`EXTRA_BCC`, `EXTRA_SUBJECT`.

Output: nothing.

Constant Value:
"android.intent.action.SEND"

### ACTION\_SENDTO

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String ACTION_SENDTO
```

Activity Action: Send a message to someone specified by the data.

Input: `getData()` is URI describing the target.

Output: nothing.

Constant Value:
"android.intent.action.SENDTO"

### ACTION\_SEND\_MULTIPLE

Added in [API level 4](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String ACTION_SEND_MULTIPLE
```

Activity Action: Deliver multiple data to someone else.

Like `ACTION_SEND`, except the data is multiple.

Input: `getType()` is the MIME type of the data being sent.
get\*ArrayListExtra can have either a `EXTRA_TEXT` or `EXTRA_STREAM` field, containing the data to be sent. If using
`EXTRA_TEXT`, you can also optionally supply `EXTRA_HTML_TEXT`
for clients to retrieve your text with HTML formatting.

Multiple types are supported, and receivers should handle mixed types
whenever possible. The right way for the receiver to check them is to
use the content resolver on each URI. The intent sender should try to
put the most concrete mime type in the intent type, but it can fall
back to <type>/\* or \*/\* as needed.

e.g. if you are sending image/jpg and image/jpg, the intent's type can
be image/jpg, but if you are sending image/jpg and image/png, then the
intent's type should be image/\*.

As of `Build.VERSION_CODES.JELLY_BEAN`, the data
being sent can be supplied through `setClipData(ClipData)`. This
allows you to use `FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION` when sharing
content: URIs and other advanced features of `ClipData`. If
using this approach, you still must supply the same data through the
`EXTRA_TEXT` or `EXTRA_STREAM` fields described below
for compatibility with old applications. If you don't set a ClipData,
it will be copied there for you when calling `Context.startActivity(Intent)`.

Starting from `Build.VERSION_CODES.O`, if
`CATEGORY_TYPED_OPENABLE` is passed, then the Uris passed in
either `EXTRA_STREAM` or via `setClipData(ClipData)` may
be openable only as asset typed files using
`ContentResolver.openTypedAssetFileDescriptor(Uri,String,Bundle)`.

Optional standard extras, which may be interpreted by some recipients as
appropriate, are: `EXTRA_EMAIL`, `EXTRA_CC`,
`EXTRA_BCC`, `EXTRA_SUBJECT`.

Output: nothing.

Constant Value:
"android.intent.action.SEND\_MULTIPLE"

### ACTION\_SET\_WALLPAPER

```
public static final String ACTION_VOICE_COMMAND
```

Activity Action: Start Voice Command.

For apps targeting or running on devices with SDK version
`Build.VERSION_CODES.BAKLAVA` or lower, the extras
`BluetoothDevice.EXTRA_DEVICE` and
`BluetoothProfile.EXTRA_PROFILE` are not
included as part of the intent.
For apps targeting versions higher than
`Build.VERSION_CODES.BAKLAVA`, the extras
`BluetoothDevice.EXTRA_DEVICE` and
`BluetoothProfile.EXTRA_PROFILE` are included as
part of the intent.

Information about the extras is below.

* *`BluetoothDevice.EXTRA_DEVICE`*
  indicates the `BluetoothDevice` which
  initiated this request.
* *`BluetoothProfile.EXTRA_PROFILE`*
  indicates the profile (e.g., `BluetoothProfile.HEADSET`
  or `BluetoothProfile.LE_AUDIO`) which triggered this
  request.

Additionally, if the `BluetoothProfile.EXTRA_PROFILE`
is `BluetoothProfile.HEADSET`, the app should call
the following APIs to start voice assistant session.

* `BluetoothHeadset.startVoiceRecognition(BluetoothDevice)`
* `ERROR(/android.media.AudioRecord#setPreferredDevice())` for the
  `AudioDeviceInfo.TYPE_BLUETOOTH_SCO` device
  whose MAC address matches the address received in
  `BluetoothDevice.EXTRA_DEVICE`
* `AudioRecord.startRecording()`

If the `BluetoothProfile.EXTRA_PROFILE` is
`BluetoothProfile.LE_AUDIO`, the app should call
the following APIs to start voice assistant session.

* `ERROR(/android.media.AudioRecord#setPreferredDevice())` for the
  `AudioDeviceInfo.TYPE_BLE_HEADSET` device
  whose MAC address matches the address received in
  `BluetoothDevice.EXTRA_DEVICE`
* `AudioRecord.startRecording()`

Output: Nothing.

In some cases, a matching Activity may not exist, so ensure you
safeguard against this.

Deprecated in
[API level
16](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String ACTION_WALLPAPER_CHANGED
```

**This constant was deprecated
in API level 16.**  
Modern applications should use
`WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_SHOW_WALLPAPER` to have the wallpaper
shown behind their UI, rather than watching for this broadcast and
rendering the wallpaper on their own.

Broadcast Action: The current system wallpaper has changed. See
`WallpaperManager` for retrieving the new wallpaper.
This should *only* be used to determine when the wallpaper
has changed to show the new wallpaper to the user. You should certainly
never, in response to this, change the wallpaper or other attributes of
it such as the suggested size. That would be unexpected, right? You'd cause
all kinds of loops, especially if other apps are doing similar things,
right? Of course. So please don't do this.

### CATEGORY\_ACCESSIBILITY\_SHORTCUT\_TARGET

Added in [API level 30](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String CATEGORY_ACCESSIBILITY_SHORTCUT_TARGET
```

The accessibility shortcut is a global gesture for users with disabilities to trigger an
important for them accessibility feature to help developers determine whether they want to
make their activity a shortcut target.

An activity of interest to users with accessibility needs may request to be the target of
the accessibility shortcut. It handles intent `ACTION_MAIN` with this category,
which will be dispatched by the system when the user activates the shortcut when it is
configured to point at this target.

An activity declared itself to be a target of the shortcut in AndroidManifest.xml. It must
also do two things:



Specify that it handles the `android.intent.action.MAIN`
`Intent`
with category `android.intent.category.ACCESSIBILITY_SHORTCUT_TARGET`.

Provide a meta-data entry `android.accessibilityshortcut.target` in the
manifest when declaring the activity.
If either of these items is missing, the system will ignore the accessibility shortcut
target. Following is an example declaration:

```
<activity android:name=".MainActivity"
. . .
  <intent-filter>
      <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
      <category android:name="android.intent.category.ACCESSIBILITY_SHORTCUT_TARGET" />
  </intent-filter>
  <meta-data android:name="android.accessibilityshortcut.target"
                  android:resource="@xml/accessibilityshortcut" />
</activity>
```

This is a sample XML file configuring a accessibility shortcut target:

```
<accessibility-shortcut-target
    android:description="@string/shortcut_target_description"
    android:summary="@string/shortcut_target_summary"
    android:animatedImageDrawable="@drawable/shortcut_target_animated_image"
    android:htmlDescription="@string/shortcut_target_html_description"
    android:settingsActivity="com.example.android.shortcut.target.SettingsActivity" />
```

Both description and summary are necessary. The system will ignore the accessibility
shortcut target if they are missing. The animated image and html description are supported
to help users understand how to use the shortcut target. The settings activity is a
component name that allows the user to modify the settings for this accessibility shortcut
target.

Constant Value:
"android.intent.category.ACCESSIBILITY\_SHORTCUT\_TARGET"

### CATEGORY\_ALTERNATIVE

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String CATEGORY_ALTERNATIVE
```

Set if the activity should be considered as an alternative action to
the data the user is currently viewing. See also
`CATEGORY_SELECTED_ALTERNATIVE` for an alternative action that
applies to the selection in a list of items.

Supporting this category means that you would like your activity to be
displayed in the set of alternative things the user can do, usually as
part of the current activity's options menu. You will usually want to
include a specific label in the <intent-filter> of this action
describing to the user what it does.

The action of IntentFilter with this category is important in that it
describes the specific action the target will perform. This generally
should not be a generic action (such as `ACTION_VIEW`, but rather
a specific name such as "com.android.camera.action.CROP. Only one
alternative of any particular action will be shown to the user, so using
a specific action like this makes sure that your alternative will be
displayed while also allowing other applications to provide their own
overrides of that particular action.

Constant Value:
"android.intent.category.ALTERNATIVE"

package. Tells the installer UI to skip the confirmation with the user
if the .apk is replacing an existing one.

Constant Value:
"android.intent.extra.ALLOW\_REPLACE"

### EXTRA\_ALTERNATE\_INTENTS

Added in [API level 23](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String EXTRA_ALTERNATE_INTENTS
```

An Intent[] describing additional, alternate choices you would like shown with
`ACTION_CHOOSER`.

An app may be capable of providing several different payload types to complete a
user's intended action. For example, an app invoking `ACTION_SEND` to share photos
with another app may use EXTRA\_ALTERNATE\_INTENTS to have the chooser transparently offer
several different supported sending mechanisms for sharing, such as the actual "image/\*"
photo data or a hosted link where the photos can be viewed.

The intent present in `EXTRA_INTENT` will be treated as the
first/primary/preferred intent in the set. Additional intents specified in
this extra are ordered; by default intents that appear earlier in the array will be
preferred over intents that appear later in the array as matches for the same
target component. To alter this preference, a calling app may also supply
`EXTRA_CHOOSER_REFINEMENT_INTENT_SENDER`.

Constant Value:
"android.intent.extra.ALTERNATE\_INTENTS"

Added in [API level 35](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String EXTRA_CHOOSER_ADDITIONAL_CONTENT_URI
```

Optional argument used to provide a `ContentProvider` `Uri` to an
`ACTION_CHOOSER` Intent which allows additional toggleable items to be included
in the sharing UI.

For example, this could be used to show photos being shared in the context of the user's
entire photo roll, with the option to change the set of photos being shared.

When this is provided in an `ACTION_CHOOSER` Intent with an `ACTION_SEND` or
`ACTION_SEND_MULTIPLE` target Intent, the sharesheet will query (see
`ContentProvider.query(Uri,String[],Bundle,CancellationSignal)`) this URI to
retrieve a set of additional items available for selection. The set of items returned by the
content provider is expected to contain all the items from the `EXTRA_STREAM`
argument, in their relative order, which will be marked as selected. The URI's authority
must be different from any shared items URI provided in `EXTRA_STREAM` or returned by
the provider.

The `Bundle` argument of the
`ContentProvider.query(Uri,String[],Bundle,CancellationSignal)`
method will contains the original intent Chooser has been launched with under the
`EXTRA_INTENT` key as a context for the current sharing session. The returned
`Cursor` should contain:

* `AdditionalContentContract.Columns.URI` column for the item
  URI.
* Optional columns `MediaStore.MediaColumns.WIDTH` and
  `MediaStore.MediaColumns.HEIGHT` for the dimensions of the preview image.
  These columns can also be returned for each `EXTRA_STREAM` item metadata
  `ContentProvider.query(Uri,String[],Bundle,CancellationSignal)` call.
* Optional `AdditionalContentContract.CursorExtraKeys.POSITION` extra that
  specifies the cursor starting position; the item at this position is expected to match the
  item specified by `EXTRA_CHOOSER_FOCUSED_ITEM_POSITION`.

When the user makes a selection change,
`ContentProvider.call(String,String,Bundle)` method will be invoked with the "method"
argument set to
`AdditionalContentContract.MethodNames.ON_SELECTION_CHANGED`,
the "arg" argument set to this argument's value, and the "extras" `Bundle` argument
containing `EXTRA_INTENT` key containing the original intent Chooser has been launched
with but with the modified target intent --Chooser will modify the target intent according to
the selection changes made by the user.
Applications may implement this method to change any of the following Chooser arguments by
returning new values in the result bundle:
`EXTRA_CHOOSER_TARGETS`,
`EXTRA_ALTERNATE_INTENTS`,
`EXTRA_CHOOSER_CUSTOM_ACTIONS`,
`EXTRA_CHOOSER_MODIFY_SHARE_ACTION`,

Annotations should describe the major components or topics of the content. It is up to
apps initiating `ACTION_CHOOSER` to learn and add annotations. Annotations should be
learned in advance, e.g., when creating or saving content, to avoid increasing latency to
start `ACTION_CHOOSER`. Names of customized annotations should not contain the colon
character. Performance on customized annotations can suffer, if they are rarely used for
`ACTION_CHOOSER` in the past 14 days. Therefore, it is recommended to use the
following annotations when applicable.

* "product" represents that the topic of the content is mainly about products, e.g.,
  health & beauty, and office supplies.
* "emotion" represents that the topic of the content is mainly about emotions, e.g.,
  happy, and sad.

  sunglasses, jewelry, handbags and clothing.
* "material" represents that the topic of the content is mainly about materials, e.g.,
  paper, and silk.

about who is launching that activity. This field contains a `Uri`
object, typically an http: or https: URI of the web site that the referral came from;
it can also use the `android-app:` scheme to identify
a native application that it came from.

To retrieve this value in a client, use `Activity.getReferrer()`
instead of directly retrieving the extra. It is also valid for applications to
instead supply `EXTRA_REFERRER_NAME` for cases where they can only create
a string, not a Uri; the field here, if supplied, will always take precedence,
however.

Constant Value:
"android.intent.extra.REFERRER"

### EXTRA\_REFERRER\_NAME

Added in [API level 22](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

### EXTRA\_REPLACEMENT\_EXTRAS

Added in [API level 21](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String EXTRA_REPLACEMENT_EXTRAS
```

A Bundle forming a mapping of potential target package names to different extras Bundles
to add to the default intent extras in `EXTRA_INTENT` when used with
`ACTION_CHOOSER`. Each key should be a package name. The package need not
be currently installed on the device.

An application may choose to provide alternate extras for the case where a user
selects an activity from a predetermined set of target packages. If the activity
the user selects from the chooser belongs to a package with its package name as
a key in this bundle, the corresponding extras for that package will be merged with
the extras already present in the intent at `EXTRA_INTENT`. If a replacement
extra has the same key as an extra already present in the intent it will overwrite
the extra from the intent.

*Examples:*

* An application may offer different `EXTRA_TEXT` to an application
  when sharing with it via `ACTION_SEND`, augmenting a link with additional query
  parameters for that target.
* An application may offer additional metadata for known targets of a given intent
  to pass along information only relevant to that target such as account or content
  identifiers already known to that application.

```
public static final String EXTRA_RESULT_RECEIVER
```

A `ResultReceiver` used to return data back to the sender.

Used to complete an app-specific
`refinement` for `ACTION_CHOOSER`.

If `EXTRA_CHOOSER_REFINEMENT_INTENT_SENDER` is present in the intent
used to start a `ACTION_CHOOSER` activity this extra will be
`filled in` to that `IntentSender` and sent
when the user selects a target component from the chooser. It is up to the recipient
to send a result to this ResultReceiver to signal that disambiguation is complete
and that the chooser should invoke the user's choice.

The disambiguator should provide a Bundle to the ResultReceiver with an intent
assigned to the key `EXTRA_INTENT`. This supplied intent will be used by the chooser
to match and fill in the final Intent or ChooserTarget before starting it.
The supplied intent must `match` one of the intents from
`EXTRA_INTENT` or `EXTRA_ALTERNATE_INTENTS` passed to
`EXTRA_CHOOSER_REFINEMENT_INTENT_SENDER` to be accepted.

The result code passed to the ResultReceiver should be
`Activity.RESULT_OK` if the refinement succeeded and the supplied intent's
target in the chooser should be started, or `Activity.RESULT_CANCELED` if
the chooser should finish without starting a target.

Constant Value:

becomes the new root of an otherwise empty task, and any old activities
are finished. This can only be used in conjunction with `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK`.

Constant Value:
32768
(0x00008000)

### FLAG\_ACTIVITY\_CLEAR\_TOP

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP
```

If set, and the activity being launched is already running in the
current task, then instead of launching a new instance of that activity,
all of the other activities on top of it will be closed and this Intent
will be delivered to the (now on top) old activity as a new Intent.

For example, consider a task consisting of the activities: A, B, C, D.
If D calls startActivity() with an Intent that resolves to the component
of activity B, then C and D will be finished and B receive the given
Intent, resulting in the stack now being: A, B.

The currently running instance of activity B in the above example will
either receive the new intent you are starting here in its
onNewIntent() method, or be itself finished and restarted with the
new intent. If it has declared its launch mode to be "multiple" (the
default) and you have not set `FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP` in
the same intent, then it will be finished and re-created; for all other
launch modes or if `FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP` is set then this
Intent will be delivered to the current instance's onNewIntent().

This launch mode can also be used to good effect in conjunction with
`FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK`: if used to start the root activity
of a task, it will bring any currently running instance of that task
to the foreground, and then clear it to its root state. This is
especially useful, for example, when launching an activity from the
notification manager.

### FLAG\_ACTIVITY\_CLEAR\_WHEN\_TASK\_RESET

Added in [API level 3](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
21](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_WHEN_TASK_RESET
```

**This constant was deprecated
in API level 21.**  
As of API 21 this performs identically to
`FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_DOCUMENT` which should be used instead of this.

Constant Value:
524288
(0x00080000)

### FLAG\_ACTIVITY\_EXCLUDE\_FROM\_RECENTS

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_ACTIVITY_EXCLUDE_FROM_RECENTS
```

If set, the new activity is not kept in the list of recently launched
activities.

Constant Value:
8388608
(0x00800000)

### FLAG\_ACTIVITY\_FORWARD\_RESULT

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_ACTIVITY_FORWARD_RESULT
```

If set and this intent is being used to launch a new activity from an
existing one, then the reply target of the existing activity will be
transferred to the new activity. This way, the new activity can call
`Activity.setResult(int)` and have that result sent back to
the reply target of the original activity.

Constant Value:
33554432
(0x02000000)

### FLAG\_ACTIVITY\_LAUNCHED\_FROM\_HISTORY

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_ACTIVITY_LAUNCHED_FROM_HISTORY
```

This flag is not normally set by application code, but set for you by
the system if this activity is being launched from history.

Constant Value:
1048576
(0x00100000)

### FLAG\_ACTIVITY\_LAUNCH\_ADJACENT

Added in [API level 24](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_ACTIVITY_LAUNCH_ADJACENT
```

This flag is only used for split-screen multi-window mode. The new activity will be displayed
adjacent to the one launching it if possible. This can only be used in conjunction with
`FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK`. Also, setting `FLAG_ACTIVITY_MULTIPLE_TASK` is
required if you want a new instance of an existing activity to be created.

Constant Value:
4096
(0x00001000)

### FLAG\_ACTIVITY\_MATCH\_EXTERNAL

Added in [API level 28](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_ACTIVITY_MATCH_EXTERNAL
```

If set in an Intent passed to `Context.startActivity()`,
this flag will attempt to launch an instant app if no full app on the device can already
handle the intent.

When attempting to resolve instant apps externally, the following `Intent` properties
are supported:

* `Intent.setAction(String)`
* `Intent.addCategory(String)`
* `Intent.setData(Uri)`
* `Intent.setType(String)`
* `Intent.setPackage(String)`
* `Intent.addFlags(int)`

In the case that no instant app can be found, the installer will be launched to notify the
user that the intent could not be resolved. On devices that do not support instant apps,
the flag will be ignored.

Constant Value:
2048
(0x00000800)

### FLAG\_ACTIVITY\_MULTIPLE\_TASK

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_ACTIVITY_MULTIPLE_TASK
```

This flag is used to create a new task and launch an activity into it.
This flag is always paired with either `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_DOCUMENT`
or `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK`. In both cases these flags alone would
search through existing tasks for ones matching this Intent. Only if no such
task is found would a new task be created. When paired with
FLAG\_ACTIVITY\_MULTIPLE\_TASK both of these behaviors are modified to skip
the search for a matching task and unconditionally start a new task.
**When used with `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK` do not use this
flag unless you are implementing your own
top-level application launcher.** Used in conjunction with
`FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK` to disable the
behavior of bringing an existing task to the foreground. When set,
a new task is *always* started to host the Activity for the
Intent, regardless of whether there is already an existing task running
the same thing.

**Because the default system does not include graphical task management,
you should not use this flag unless you provide some way for a user to
return back to the tasks you have launched.**
See `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_DOCUMENT` for details of this flag's use for
creating new document tasks.

This flag is ignored if one of `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK` or
`FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_DOCUMENT` is not also set.

See
[Tasks and Back
Stack](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/fundamentals/tasks-and-back-stack) for more information about tasks.

* `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_DOCUMENT`
* `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK`

Constant Value:
134217728
(0x08000000)

### FLAG\_ACTIVITY\_NEW\_DOCUMENT

Added in [API level 21](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_DOCUMENT
```

This flag is used to open a document into a new task rooted at the activity launched
by this Intent. Through the use of this flag, or its equivalent attribute,
`R.attr.documentLaunchMode` multiple instances of the same activity
containing different documents will appear in the recent tasks list.

The use of the activity attribute form of this,
`R.attr.documentLaunchMode`, is
preferred over the Intent flag described here. The attribute form allows the
Activity to specify multiple document behavior for all launchers of the Activity
whereas using this flag requires each Intent that launches the Activity to specify it.

Note that the default semantics of this flag w.r.t. whether the recents entry for
it is kept after the activity is finished is different than the use of
`FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK` and `R.attr.documentLaunchMode` -- if
this flag is being used to create a new recents entry, then by default that entry
will be removed once the activity is finished. You can modify this behavior with
`FLAG_ACTIVITY_RETAIN_IN_RECENTS`.

FLAG\_ACTIVITY\_NEW\_DOCUMENT may be used in conjunction with `FLAG_ACTIVITY_MULTIPLE_TASK`. When used alone it is the
equivalent of the Activity manifest specifying `R.attr.documentLaunchMode`="intoExisting". When used with
FLAG\_ACTIVITY\_MULTIPLE\_TASK it is the equivalent of the Activity manifest specifying
`R.attr.documentLaunchMode`="always". The flag is ignored even in
conjunction with `FLAG_ACTIVITY_MULTIPLE_TASK` when the Activity manifest specifies
`R.attr.documentLaunchMode`="never".
Refer to `R.attr.documentLaunchMode` for more information.

**See also:**

* `R.attr.documentLaunchMode`
* `FLAG_ACTIVITY_MULTIPLE_TASK`

Constant Value:

(0x00080000)

### FLAG\_ACTIVITY\_NEW\_TASK

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK
```

If set, this activity will become the start of a new task on this
history stack. A task (from the activity that started it to the
next task activity) defines an atomic group of activities that the
user can move to. Tasks can be moved to the foreground and background;
all of the activities inside of a particular task always remain in
the same order. See
[Tasks and Back
Stack](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/fundamentals/tasks-and-back-stack) for more information about tasks.

This flag is generally used by activities that want
to present a "launcher" style behavior: they give the user a list of
separate things that can be done, which otherwise run completely
independently of the activity launching them.

When using this flag, if a task is already running for the activity
you are now starting, then a new activity will not be started; instead,
the current task will simply be brought to the front of the screen with
the state it was last in. See `FLAG_ACTIVITY_MULTIPLE_TASK` for a flag
to disable this behavior.

This flag can not be used when the caller is requesting a result from
the activity being launched.

Constant Value:
268435456
(0x10000000)

### FLAG\_ACTIVITY\_NO\_ANIMATION

Added in [API level 5](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_ANIMATION
```

If set in an Intent passed to `Context.startActivity()`,
this flag will prevent the system from applying an activity transition
animation to go to the next activity state. This doesn't mean an
animation will never run -- if another activity change happens that doesn't
specify this flag before the activity started here is displayed, then
that transition will be used. This flag can be put to good use
when you are going to do a series of activity operations but the
animation seen by the user shouldn't be driven by the first activity
change but rather a later one.

Constant Value:
65536
(0x00010000)

### FLAG\_ACTIVITY\_NO\_HISTORY

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_HISTORY
```

If set, the new activity is not kept in the history stack. As soon as
the user navigates away from it, the activity is finished. This may also
be set with the `noHistory` attribute.

If set, `onActivityResult()`
is never invoked when the current activity starts a new activity which
sets a result and finishes.

Constant Value:
1073741824
(0x40000000)

### FLAG\_ACTIVITY\_NO\_USER\_ACTION

Added in [API level 3](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_USER_ACTION
```

If set, this flag will prevent the normal `Activity.onUserLeaveHint()`
callback from occurring on the current frontmost activity before it is
paused as the newly-started activity is brought to the front.

Typically, an activity can rely on that callback to indicate that an
explicit user action has caused their activity to be moved out of the
foreground. The callback marks an appropriate point in the activity's
lifecycle for it to dismiss any notifications that it intends to display
"until the user has seen them," such as a blinking LED.

If an activity is ever started via any non-user-driven events such as
phone-call receipt or an alarm handler, this flag should be passed to `Context.startActivity`, ensuring that the pausing
activity does not think the user has acknowledged its notification.

Constant Value:
262144
(0x00040000)

### FLAG\_ACTIVITY\_PREVIOUS\_IS\_TOP

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_ACTIVITY_PREVIOUS_IS_TOP
```

If set and this intent is being used to launch a new activity from an
existing one, the current activity will not be counted as the top
activity for deciding whether the new intent should be delivered to
the top instead of starting a new one. The previous activity will
be used as the top, with the assumption being that the current activity
will finish itself immediately.

Constant Value:
16777216
(0x01000000)

### FLAG\_ACTIVITY\_REORDER\_TO\_FRONT

Added in [API level 3](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_ACTIVITY_REORDER_TO_FRONT
```

If set in an Intent passed to `Context.startActivity()`,
this flag will cause the launched activity to be brought to the front of its
task's history stack if it is already running.

For example, consider a task consisting of four activities: A, B, C, D.
If D calls startActivity() with an Intent that resolves to the component
of activity B, then B will be brought to the front of the history stack,
with this resulting order: A, C, D, B.
This flag will be ignored if `FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP` is also
specified.

Constant Value:
131072
(0x00020000)

### FLAG\_ACTIVITY\_REQUIRE\_DEFAULT

Added in [API level 30](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_ACTIVITY_REQUIRE_DEFAULT
```

If set in an intent passed to `Context.startActivity()`, this
flag will only launch the intent if it resolves to a single result. If no such result exists
or if the system chooser would otherwise be displayed, an `ActivityNotFoundException`
will be thrown.

Constant Value:
512
(0x00000200)

### FLAG\_ACTIVITY\_REQUIRE\_NON\_BROWSER

Added in [API level 30](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_ACTIVITY_REQUIRE_NON_BROWSER
```

If set in an intent passed to `Context.startActivity()`, this
flag will only launch the intent if it resolves to a result that is not a browser. If no such
result exists, an `ActivityNotFoundException` will be thrown.

Constant Value:
1024
(0x00000400)

### FLAG\_ACTIVITY\_RESET\_TASK\_IF\_NEEDED

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_ACTIVITY_RESET_TASK_IF_NEEDED
```

If set, and this activity is either being started in a new task or
bringing to the top an existing task, then it will be launched as
the front door of the task. This will result in the application of
any affinities needed to have that task in the proper state (either
moving activities to or from it), or simply resetting that task to
its initial state if needed.

**See also:**

* `R.attr.allowTaskReparenting`
* `R.attr.clearTaskOnLaunch`
* `R.attr.finishOnTaskLaunch`

Constant Value:
2097152
(0x00200000)

### FLAG\_ACTIVITY\_RETAIN\_IN\_RECENTS

Added in [API level 21](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_ACTIVITY_RETAIN_IN_RECENTS
```

By default a document created by `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_DOCUMENT` will
have its entry in recent tasks removed when the user closes it (with back
or however else it may finish()). If you would like to instead allow the
document to be kept in recents so that it can be re-launched, you can use
this flag. When set and the task's activity is finished, the recents
entry will remain in the interface for the user to re-launch it, like a
recents entry for a top-level application.

The receiving activity can override this request with
`R.attr.autoRemoveFromRecents` or by explcitly calling
`Activity.finishAndRemoveTask()`.

Constant Value:
8192
(0x00002000)

### FLAG\_ACTIVITY\_SINGLE\_TOP

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP
```

If set, the activity will not be launched if it is already running
at the top of the history stack. See
[Tasks and Back Stack](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/fundamentals/tasks-and-back-stack#TaskLaunchModes) for more information.

Constant Value:
536870912
(0x20000000)

### FLAG\_ACTIVITY\_TASK\_ON\_HOME

Added in [API level 11](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_ACTIVITY_TASK_ON_HOME
```

If set in an Intent passed to `Context.startActivity()`,
this flag will cause a newly launching task to be placed on top of the current
home activity task (if there is one). That is, pressing back from the task
will always return the user to home even if that was not the last activity they
saw. This can only be used in conjunction with `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK`.

Constant Value:
16384
(0x00004000)

### FLAG\_DEBUG\_LOG\_RESOLUTION

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_DEBUG_LOG_RESOLUTION
```

A flag you can enable for debugging: when set, log messages will be
printed during the resolution of this intent to show you what has
been found to create the final resolved list.

Constant Value:
8
(0x00000008)

### FLAG\_DIRECT\_BOOT\_AUTO

Added in [API level 29](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_DIRECT_BOOT_AUTO
```

Flag used to automatically match intents based on their Direct Boot
awareness and the current user state.

Since the default behavior is to automatically apply the current user
state, this is effectively a sentinel value that doesn't change the
output of any queries based on its presence or absence.

Instead, this value can be useful in conjunction with
`StrictMode.VmPolicy.Builder.detectImplicitDirectBoot()`
to detect when a caller is relying on implicit automatic matching,
instead of confirming the explicit behavior they want.

Constant Value:
256
(0x00000100)

### FLAG\_EXCLUDE\_STOPPED\_PACKAGES

Added in [API level 12](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_EXCLUDE_STOPPED_PACKAGES
```

If set, this intent will not match any components in packages that
are currently
[stopped](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/ApplicationInfo#FLAG_STOPPED).
If this is not set, then the default behavior is to include such
applications in the result.

Constant Value:
16
(0x00000010)

### FLAG\_FROM\_BACKGROUND

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_FROM_BACKGROUND
```

Can be set by the caller to indicate that this Intent is coming from
a background operation, not from direct user interaction.

Constant Value:
4
(0x00000004)

### FLAG\_GRANT\_PERSISTABLE\_URI\_PERMISSION

Added in [API level 19](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_GRANT_PERSISTABLE_URI_PERMISSION
```

When combined with `FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION` and/or
`FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION`, the URI permission grant can be
persisted across device reboots until explicitly revoked with
`Context.revokeUriPermission(Uri,int)`. This flag only offers the
grant for possible persisting; the receiving application must call
`ContentResolver.takePersistableUriPermission(Uri,int)` to
actually persist.

**See also:**

* `ContentResolver.takePersistableUriPermission(Uri,int)`
* `ContentResolver.releasePersistableUriPermission(Uri,int)`
* `ContentResolver.getPersistedUriPermissions()`
* `ContentResolver.getOutgoingPersistedUriPermissions()`

Constant Value:
64
(0x00000040)

### FLAG\_GRANT\_PREFIX\_URI\_PERMISSION

Added in [API level 21](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_GRANT_PREFIX_URI_PERMISSION
```

When combined with `FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION` and/or
`FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION`, the URI permission grant
applies to any URI that is a prefix match against the original granted
URI. (Without this flag, the URI must match exactly for access to be
granted.) Another URI is considered a prefix match only when scheme,
authority, and all path segments defined by the prefix are an exact
match.

Constant Value:
128
(0x00000080)

### FLAG\_GRANT\_READ\_URI\_PERMISSION

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION
```

If set, the recipient of this Intent will be granted permission to
perform read operations on the URI in the Intent's data and any URIs
specified in its ClipData. When applying to an Intent's ClipData,
all URIs as well as recursive traversals through data or other ClipData
in Intent items will be granted; only the grant flags of the top-level
Intent are used.

Constant Value:
1
(0x00000001)

### FLAG\_GRANT\_WRITE\_URI\_PERMISSION

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION
```

If set, the recipient of this Intent will be granted permission to
perform write operations on the URI in the Intent's data and any URIs
specified in its ClipData. When applying to an Intent's ClipData,
all URIs as well as recursive traversals through data or other ClipData
in Intent items will be granted; only the grant flags of the top-level
Intent are used.

Constant Value:
2
(0x00000002)

### FLAG\_INCLUDE\_STOPPED\_PACKAGES

Added in [API level 12](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_INCLUDE_STOPPED_PACKAGES
```

If set, this intent will always match any components in packages that
are currently
[stopped](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/ApplicationInfo#FLAG_STOPPED).
This is the default behavior when
`FLAG_EXCLUDE_STOPPED_PACKAGES` is not set. If both of these
flags are set, this one wins (it allows overriding of exclude for
places where the framework may automatically set the exclude flag,
such as broadcasts).

Constant Value:
32
(0x00000020)

### FLAG\_RECEIVER\_FOREGROUND

Added in [API level 16](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_RECEIVER_FOREGROUND
```

If set, when sending a broadcast the recipient is allowed to run at
foreground priority, with a shorter timeout interval. During normal
broadcasts the receivers are not automatically hoisted out of the
background priority class.

Constant Value:
268435456
(0x10000000)

### FLAG\_RECEIVER\_NO\_ABORT

Added in [API level 19](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_RECEIVER_NO_ABORT
```

If this is an ordered broadcast, don't allow receivers to abort the broadcast.
They can still propagate results through to later receivers, but they can not prevent
later receivers from seeing the broadcast.

Constant Value:
134217728
(0x08000000)

### FLAG\_RECEIVER\_REGISTERED\_ONLY

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_RECEIVER_REGISTERED_ONLY
```

If set, when sending a broadcast only registered receivers will be
called -- no BroadcastReceiver components will be launched.

Constant Value:
1073741824
(0x40000000)

### FLAG\_RECEIVER\_REPLACE\_PENDING

Added in [API level 8](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_RECEIVER_REPLACE_PENDING
```

If set, when sending a broadcast the new broadcast will replace
any existing pending broadcast that matches it. Matching is defined
by `Intent.filterEquals` returning
true for the intents of the two broadcasts. When a match is found,
the new broadcast (and receivers associated with it) will replace the
existing one in the pending broadcast list, remaining at the same
position in the list.

This flag is most typically used with sticky broadcasts, which
only care about delivering the most recent values of the broadcast
to their receivers.

Constant Value:
536870912
(0x20000000)

### FLAG\_RECEIVER\_VISIBLE\_TO\_INSTANT\_APPS

Added in [API level 26](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int FLAG_RECEIVER_VISIBLE_TO_INSTANT_APPS
```

If set, the broadcast will be visible to receivers in Instant Apps. By default Instant Apps
will not receive broadcasts.
*This flag has no effect when used by an Instant App.*

Constant Value:
2097152
(0x00200000)

### METADATA\_DOCK\_HOME

Added in [API level 5](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String METADATA_DOCK_HOME
```

Boolean that can be supplied as meta-data with a dock activity, to
indicate that the dock should take over the home key when it is active.

Constant Value:
"android.dock\_home"

### URI\_ALLOW\_UNSAFE

Added in [API level 22](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int URI_ALLOW_UNSAFE
```

Flag for use with `toUri(int)` and `parseUri(String, int)`: allow parsing
of unsafe information. In particular, the flags `FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION`,
`FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION`, `FLAG_GRANT_PERSISTABLE_URI_PERMISSION`,
and `FLAG_GRANT_PREFIX_URI_PERMISSION` flags can not be set, so that the
generated Intent can not cause unexpected data access to happen.

If you do not trust the source of the URI being parsed, you should still do further
processing to protect yourself from it. In particular, when using it to start an
activity you should usually add in `CATEGORY_BROWSABLE` to limit the activities
that can handle it.

Constant Value:
4
(0x00000004)

### URI\_ANDROID\_APP\_SCHEME

Added in [API level 22](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int URI_ANDROID_APP_SCHEME
```

Flag for use with `toUri(int)` and `parseUri(String, int)`: the URI string
always has the "android-app:" scheme. This is a variation of
`URI_INTENT_SCHEME` whose format is simpler for the case of an
http/https URI being delivered to a specific package name. The format
is:

```
android-app://{package_id}[/{scheme}[/{host}[/{path}]]][#Intent;{...}]
```

In this scheme, only the `package_id` is required. If you include a host,
you must also include a scheme; including a path also requires both a host and a scheme.
The final #Intent; fragment can be used without a scheme, host, or path.
Note that this can not be
used with intents that have a `setSelector(Intent)`, since the base intent
will always have an explicit package name.

Some examples of how this scheme maps to Intent objects:

| URI | Intent |
| --- | --- |
| `android-app://com.example.app` | |  |  | | --- | --- | | Action: | `ACTION_MAIN` | | Package: | `com.example.app` | |
| `android-app://com.example.app/http/example.com` | |  |  | | --- | --- | | Action: | `ACTION_VIEW` | | Data: | `http://example.com/` | | Package: | `com.example.app` | |
| `android-app://com.example.app/http/example.com/foo?1234` | |  |  | | --- | --- | | Action: | `ACTION_VIEW` | | Data: | `http://example.com/foo?1234` | | Package: | `com.example.app` | |
| `android-app://com.example.app/ #Intent;action=com.example.MY_ACTION;end` | |  |  | | --- | --- | | Action: | `com.example.MY_ACTION` | | Package: | `com.example.app` | |
| `android-app://com.example.app/http/example.com/foo?1234 #Intent;action=com.example.MY_ACTION;end` | |  |  | | --- | --- | | Action: | `com.example.MY_ACTION` | | Data: | `http://example.com/foo?1234` | | Package: | `com.example.app` | |
| `android-app://com.example.app/ #Intent;action=com.example.MY_ACTION; i.some_int=100;S.some_str=hello;end` | |  |  | | --- | --- | | Action: | `com.example.MY_ACTION` | | Package: | `com.example.app` | | Extras: | `some_int=(int)100 some_str=(String)hello` | |

### URI\_INTENT\_SCHEME

Added in [API level 4](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int URI_INTENT_SCHEME
```

Flag for use with `toUri(int)` and `parseUri(String, int)`: the URI string
always has the "intent:" scheme. This syntax can be used when you want
to later disambiguate between URIs that are intended to describe an
Intent vs. all others that should be treated as raw URIs. When used
with `parseUri(String, int)`, any other scheme will result in a generic
VIEW action for that raw URI.

Constant Value:
1
(0x00000001)




## Fields

### CREATOR

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final Creator<Intent> CREATOR
```




## Public constructors

### Intent

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Intent ()
```

Create an empty intent.

### Intent

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Intent (Context packageContext, 
                Class<?> cls)
```

Create an intent for a specific component. All other fields (action, data,
type, class) are null, though they can be modified later with explicit
calls. This provides a convenient way to create an intent that is
intended to execute a hard-coded class name, rather than relying on the
system to find an appropriate class for you; see `setComponent(ComponentName)`
for more information on the repercussions of this.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `packageContext` | `Context`: A Context of the application package implementing this class. |
| `cls` | `Class`: The component class that is to be used for the intent. |

**See also:**

* `setClass(Context, Class)`
* `setComponent(ComponentName)`
* `Intent(String,android.net.Uri,Context,Class)`

### Intent

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Intent (Intent o)
```

Copy constructor.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `o` | `Intent` |

### Intent

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Intent (String action)
```

Create an intent with a given action. All other fields (data, type,
class) are null. Note that the action *must* be in a
namespace because Intents are used globally in the system -- for
example the system VIEW action is android.intent.action.VIEW; an
application's custom action would be something like
com.google.app.myapp.CUSTOM\_ACTION.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `action` | `String`: The Intent action, such as ACTION\_VIEW. |

### Intent

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Intent (String action, 
                Uri uri)
```

Create an intent with a given action and for a given data url. Note
that the action *must* be in a namespace because Intents are
used globally in the system -- for example the system VIEW action is
android.intent.action.VIEW; an application's custom action would be
something like com.google.app.myapp.CUSTOM\_ACTION.

*Note: scheme and host name matching in the Android framework is
case-sensitive, unlike the formal RFC. As a result,
you should always ensure that you write your Uri with these elements
using lower case letters, and normalize any Uris you receive from
outside of Android to ensure the scheme and host is lower case.*

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `action` | `String`: The Intent action, such as ACTION\_VIEW. |
| `uri` | `Uri`: The Intent data URI. |

### Intent

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Intent (String action, 
                Uri uri, 
                Context packageContext, 
                Class<?> cls)
```

Create an intent for a specific component with a specified action and data.
This is equivalent to using `Intent(String,android.net.Uri)` to
construct the Intent and then calling `setClass(Context, Class)` to set its
class.

*Note: scheme and host name matching in the Android framework is
case-sensitive, unlike the formal RFC. As a result,
you should always ensure that you write your Uri with these elements
using lower case letters, and normalize any Uris you receive from
outside of Android to ensure the scheme and host is lower case.*

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `action` | `String`: The Intent action, such as ACTION\_VIEW. |
| `uri` | `Uri`: The Intent data URI. |
| `packageContext` | `Context`: A Context of the application package implementing this class. |
| `cls` | `Class`: The component class that is to be used for the intent. |

### addCategory

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Intent addCategory (String category)
```

Add a new category to the intent. Categories provide additional detail
about the action the intent performs. When resolving an intent, only
activities that provide *all* of the requested categories will be
used.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `category` | `String`: The desired category. This can be either one of the predefined Intent categories, or a custom category in your own namespace. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Intent` | Returns the same Intent object, for chaining multiple calls into a single statement.   This value cannot be `null`. |

**See also:**

* `hasCategory(String)`
* `removeCategory(String)`

* `setFlags(int)`
* `getFlags()`
* `removeFlags(int)`

### clone

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Object clone ()
```

Creates and returns a copy of this object. The precise meaning
of "copy" may depend on the class of the object. The general
intent is that, for any object `x`, the expression:
> ```
> x.clone() != x
> ```

will be true, and that the expression:
> ```
> x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()
> ```

will be `true`, but these are not absolute requirements.
While it is typically the case that:
> ```
> x.clone().equals(x)
> ```

will be `true`, this is not an absolute requirement.

By convention, the returned object should be obtained by calling
`super.clone`. If a class and all of its superclasses (except
`Object`) obey this convention, it will be the case that
`x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()`.

By convention, the object returned by this method should be independent
of this object (which is being cloned). To achieve this independence,
it may be necessary to modify one or more fields of the object returned
by `super.clone` before returning it. Typically, this means
copying any mutable objects that comprise the internal "deep structure"
of the object being cloned and replacing the references to these
objects with references to the copies. If a class contains only
primitive fields or references to immutable objects, then it is usually
the case that no fields in the object returned by `super.clone`
need to be modified.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Object` | a clone of this instance. |

### cloneFilter

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Intent cloneFilter ()
```

Make a clone of only the parts of the Intent that are relevant for
filter matching: the action, data, type, component, and categories.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Intent` | This value cannot be `null`. |

### createChooser

Added in [API level 22](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static Intent createChooser (Intent target, 
                CharSequence title, 
                IntentSender sender)
```

Convenience function for creating a `ACTION_CHOOSER` Intent.

Builds a new `ACTION_CHOOSER` Intent that wraps the given
target intent, also optionally supplying a title. If the target
intent has specified `FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION` or
`FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION`, then these flags will also be
set in the returned chooser intent, with its ClipData set appropriately:
either a direct reflection of `getClipData()` if that is non-null,
or a new ClipData built from `getData()`.

The caller may optionally supply an `IntentSender` to receive a callback
when the user makes a choice. This can be useful if the calling application wants
to remember the last chosen target and surface it as a more prominent or one-touch
affordance elsewhere in the UI for next time.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `target` | `Intent`: The Intent that the user will be selecting an activity to perform. |
| `title` | `CharSequence`: Optional title that will be displayed in the chooser, only when the target action is not ACTION\_SEND or ACTION\_SEND\_MULTIPLE. |
| `sender` | `IntentSender`: Optional IntentSender to be called when a choice is made. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Intent` | Return a new Intent object that you can hand to `Context.startActivity()` and related methods. |

### createChooser

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static Intent createChooser (Intent target, 
                CharSequence title)
```

Convenience function for creating a `ACTION_CHOOSER` Intent.

Builds a new `ACTION_CHOOSER` Intent that wraps the given
target intent, also optionally supplying a title. If the target
intent has specified `FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION` or
`FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION`, then these flags will also be
set in the returned chooser intent, with its ClipData set appropriately:
either a direct reflection of `getClipData()` if that is non-null,
or a new ClipData built from `getData()`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `target` | `Intent`: The Intent that the user will be selecting an activity to perform. |
| `title` | `CharSequence`: Optional title that will be displayed in the chooser, only when the target action is not ACTION\_SEND or ACTION\_SEND\_MULTIPLE. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Intent` | Return a new Intent object that you can hand to `Context.startActivity()` and related methods. |

### describeContents

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public int describeContents ()
```

Describe the kinds of special objects contained in this Parcelable
instance's marshaled representation. For example, if the object will
include a file descriptor in the output of `writeToParcel(Parcel,int)`,
the return value of this method must include the
`CONTENTS_FILE_DESCRIPTOR` bit.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `int` | a bitmask indicating the set of special object types marshaled by this Parcelable object instance.   Value is either `0` or  * `CONTENTS_FILE_DESCRIPTOR` |

### fillIn

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public int fillIn (Intent other, 
                int flags)
```

Copy the contents of other in to this object, but only
where fields are not defined by this object. For purposes of a field
being defined, the following pieces of data in the Intent are
considered to be separate fields:

* action, as set by `setAction(String)`.* data Uri and MIME type, as set by `setData(Uri)`,
    `setType(String)`, or `setDataAndType(Uri,String)`.* identifier, as set by `setIdentifier(String)`.* categories, as set by `addCategory(String)`.* package, as set by `setPackage(String)`.* component, as set by `setComponent(ComponentName)` or
            related methods.* source bounds, as set by `setSourceBounds(Rect)`.* selector, as set by `setSelector(Intent)`.* clip data, as set by `setClipData(ClipData)`.* each top-level name in the associated extras.

In addition, you can use the `FILL_IN_ACTION`,
`FILL_IN_DATA`, `FILL_IN_IDENTIFIER`, `FILL_IN_CATEGORIES`,
`FILL_IN_PACKAGE`, `FILL_IN_COMPONENT`, `FILL_IN_SOURCE_BOUNDS`,
`FILL_IN_SELECTOR`, and `FILL_IN_CLIP_DATA` to override
the restriction where the corresponding field will not be replaced if
it is already set.

Note: The component field will only be copied if `FILL_IN_COMPONENT`
is explicitly specified. The selector will only be copied if
`FILL_IN_SELECTOR` is explicitly specified.

For example, consider Intent A with {data="foo", categories="bar"}
and Intent B with {action="gotit", data-type="some/thing",
categories="one","two"}.

Calling A.fillIn(B, Intent.FILL\_IN\_DATA) will result in A now
containing: {action="gotit", data-type="some/thing",
categories="bar"}.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `other` | `Intent`: Another Intent whose values are to be used to fill in the current one.   This value cannot be `null`. |

| `flags` | `int`: Options to control which fields can be filled in.   Value is either `0` or a combination of the following:  * `FILL_IN_ACTION` * `FILL_IN_DATA` * `FILL_IN_CATEGORIES` * `FILL_IN_COMPONENT` * `FILL_IN_PACKAGE` * `FILL_IN_SOURCE_BOUNDS` * `FILL_IN_SELECTOR` * `FILL_IN_CLIP_DATA` |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `int` | Returns a bit mask of `FILL_IN_ACTION`, `FILL_IN_DATA`, `FILL_IN_CATEGORIES`, `FILL_IN_PACKAGE`, `FILL_IN_COMPONENT`, `FILL_IN_SOURCE_BOUNDS`, `FILL_IN_SELECTOR` and `FILL_IN_CLIP_DATA` indicating which fields were changed.   Value is either `0` or a combination of the following:  * `FILL_IN_ACTION` * `FILL_IN_DATA` * `FILL_IN_CATEGORIES` * `FILL_IN_COMPONENT` * `FILL_IN_PACKAGE` * `FILL_IN_SOURCE_BOUNDS` * `FILL_IN_SELECTOR` * `FILL_IN_CLIP_DATA` |

### filterEquals

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean filterEquals (Intent other)
```

Determine if two intents are the same for the purposes of intent
resolution (filtering). That is, if their action, data, type, identity,
class, and categories are the same. This does *not* compare
any extra data included in the intents. Note that technically when actually
matching against an `IntentFilter` the identifier is ignored, while here
it is directly compared for equality like the other fields.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `other` | `Intent`: The other Intent to compare against. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | Returns true if action, data, type, class, and categories are the same. |

### isMismatchingFilter

Added in [API level 35](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean isMismatchingFilter ()
```

Whether the intent mismatches all intent filters declared in the receiving component.

When a component receives an intent, normally obtainable through the following methods:

* `BroadcastReceiver.onReceive(Context,Intent)`* `Activity.getIntent()`* `Activity.onNewIntent(Intent)`* `android.app.Service.onStartCommand(Intent,int,int)`* `android.app.Service.onBind(Intent)`

The developer can call this method to check if this intent does not match any of its
declared intent filters. A non-matching intent can be delivered when the intent sender
explicitly set the component through `setComponent(ComponentName)` or `setClassName(Context, String)`.

This method always returns `false` if the intent originated from within the same
application or the system, because these cases are always exempted from security checks.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | Returns true if the intent does not match any intent filters declared in the receiving component. |

### makeMainActivity

Added in [API level 11](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static Intent makeMainActivity (ComponentName mainActivity)
```

Create an intent to launch the main (root) activity of a task. This
is the Intent that is started when the application's is launched from
Home. For anything else that wants to launch an application in the
same way, it is important that they use an Intent structured the same
way, and can use this function to ensure this is the case.

The returned Intent has the given Activity component as its explicit
component, `ACTION_MAIN` as its action, and includes the
category `CATEGORY_LAUNCHER`. This does *not* have
`FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK` set, though typically you will want
to do that through `addFlags(int)` on the returned Intent.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `mainActivity` | `ComponentName`: The main activity component that this Intent will launch. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Intent` | Returns a newly created Intent that can be used to launch the activity as a main application entry. |

**See also:**

* `setClass(Context, Class)`
* `setComponent(ComponentName)`

### makeMainSelectorActivity

Added in [API level 15](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static Intent makeMainSelectorActivity (String selectorAction, 
                String selectorCategory)
```

Make an Intent for the main activity of an application, without
specifying a specific activity to run but giving a selector to find
the activity. This results in a final Intent that is structured
the same as when the application is launched from
Home. For anything else that wants to launch an application in the
same way, it is important that they use an Intent structured the same
way, and can use this function to ensure this is the case.

The returned Intent has `ACTION_MAIN` as its action, and includes the
category `CATEGORY_LAUNCHER`. This does *not* have
`FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK` set, though typically you will want
to do that through `addFlags(int)` on the returned Intent.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `selectorAction` | `String`: The action name of the Intent's selector. |
| `selectorCategory` | `String`: The name of a category to add to the Intent's selector. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Intent` | Returns a newly created Intent that can be used to launch the activity as a main application entry. |

**See also:**

* `setSelector(Intent)`

### makeRestartActivityTask

Added in [API level 11](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static Intent makeRestartActivityTask (ComponentName mainActivity)
```

Make an Intent that can be used to re-launch an application's task
in its base state. This is like `makeMainActivity(ComponentName)`,
but also sets the flags `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK` and
`FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `mainActivity` | `ComponentName`: The activity component that is the root of the task; this is the activity that has been published in the application's manifest as the main launcher icon. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Intent` | Returns a newly created Intent that can be used to relaunch the activity's task in its root state. |

### normalizeMimeType

Added in [API level 16](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static String normalizeMimeType (String type)
```

Normalize a MIME data type.

A normalized MIME type has white-space trimmed,
content-type parameters removed, and is lower-case.
This aligns the type with Android best practices for
intent filtering.

For example, "text/plain; charset=utf-8" becomes "text/plain".
"text/x-vCard" becomes "text/x-vcard".

All MIME types received from outside Android (such as user input,
or external sources like Bluetooth, NFC, or the Internet) should
be normalized before they are used to create an Intent.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `type` | `String`: MIME data type to normalize.   This value may be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `String` | normalized MIME data type, or null if the input was null |

                XmlPullParser parser, 
                AttributeSet attrs)
```

Parses the "intent" element (and its children) from XML and instantiates
an Intent object. The given XML parser should be located at the tag
where parsing should start (often named "intent"), from which the
basic action, data, type, and package and class name will be
retrieved. The function will then parse in to any child elements,
looking for  tags to add categories and
 to attach extra data
to the intent.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `resources` | `Resources`: The Resources to use when inflating resources.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `parser` | `XmlPullParser`: The XML parser pointing at an "intent" tag.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `attrs` | `AttributeSet`: The AttributeSet interface for retrieving extended attribute data at the current parser location. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Intent` | An Intent object matching the XML data.   This value cannot be `null`. |

| Throws | |
| --- | --- |
| `IOException` | If there was an I/O error. |
| `XmlPullParserException` | If there was an XML parsing error. |

### parseUri

```
public static Intent parseUri (String uri, 
                int flags)
```

Create an intent from a URI. This URI may encode the action,
category, and other intent fields, if it was returned by
`toUri(int)`. If the Intent was not generated by toUri(), its data
will be the entire URI and its action will be ACTION\_VIEW.

The URI given here must not be relative -- that is, it must include
the scheme and full path.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `uri` | `String`: The URI to turn into an Intent. |
| `flags` | `int`: Additional processing flags.   Value is either `0` or a combination of the following:  * `URI_ALLOW_UNSAFE` * `URI_ANDROID_APP_SCHEME` * `URI_INTENT_SCHEME` |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Intent` | Intent The newly created Intent object. |

| Throws | |
| --- | --- |
| `URISyntaxException` | Throws URISyntaxError if the basic URI syntax it bad (as parsed by the Uri class) or the Intent data within the URI is invalid. |

### removeLaunchSecurityProtection

Added in [API level 36](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void removeLaunchSecurityProtection ()
```

When an intent comes from another app or component as an embedded extra intent, the system
creates a token to identify the creator of this foreign intent. If this token is missing or
invalid, the system will block the launch of this intent. If it contains a valid token, the
system will perform verification against the creator to block launching target it has no
permission to launch or block it from granting URI access to the tagert it cannot access.
This method provides a way to opt out this feature.

### replaceExtras

Added in [API level 3](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Intent replaceExtras (Intent src)
```

Completely replace the extras in the Intent with the extras in the
given Intent.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `src` | `Intent`: The exact extras contained in this Intent are copied into the target intent, replacing any that were previously there.   This value cannot be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Intent` | This value cannot be `null`. |

### replaceExtras

Added in [API level 3](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Intent replaceExtras (Bundle extras)
```

Completely replace the extras in the Intent with the given Bundle of
extras.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `extras` | `Bundle`: The new set of extras in the Intent, or null to erase all extras. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Intent` | This value cannot be `null`. |

### resolveActivity

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public ComponentName resolveActivity (PackageManager pm)
```

Return the Activity component that should be used to handle this intent.
The appropriate component is determined based on the information in the
intent, evaluated as follows:

If `getComponent()` returns an explicit class, that is returned
without any further consideration.

The activity must handle the `Intent.CATEGORY_DEFAULT` Intent
category to be considered.

If `getAction()` is non-NULL, the activity must handle this
action.

If `resolveType(ContentResolver)` returns non-NULL, the activity must handle
this type.

If `addCategory(String)` has added any categories, the activity must
handle ALL of the categories specified.

If `getPackage()` is non-NULL, only activity components in
that application package will be considered.

If there are no activities that satisfy all of these conditions, a
null string is returned.

If multiple activities are found to satisfy the intent, the one with
the highest priority will be used. If there are multiple activities
with the same priority, the system will either pick the best activity
based on user preference, or resolve to a system class that will allow
the user to pick an activity and forward from there.

This method is implemented simply by calling
`PackageManager.resolveActivity` with the "defaultOnly" parameter
true.

This API is called for you as part of starting an activity from an
intent. You do not normally need to call it yourself.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `pm` | `PackageManager`: The package manager with which to resolve the Intent.   This value cannot be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `ComponentName` | Name of the component implementing an activity that can display the intent. |

**See also:**

* `setComponent(ComponentName)`
* `getComponent()`
* `resolveActivityInfo(PackageManager, int)`

### resolveActivityInfo

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public ActivityInfo resolveActivityInfo (PackageManager pm, 
                int flags)
```

Resolve the Intent into an `ActivityInfo`
describing the activity that should execute the intent. Resolution
follows the same rules as described for `resolveActivity(PackageManager)`, but
you get back the completely information about the resolved activity
instead of just its class name.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `pm` | `PackageManager`: The package manager with which to resolve the Intent.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `flags` | `int`: Addition information to retrieve as per `PackageManager.getActivityInfo()`.   Value is either `0` or a combination of the following:  * `PackageManager.GET_META_DATA` * `PackageManager.GET_SHARED_LIBRARY_FILES` * `PackageManager.MATCH_ALL` * `PackageManager.MATCH_DEFAULT_ONLY` * `PackageManager.MATCH_DISABLED_COMPONENTS` * `PackageManager.MATCH_DISABLED_UNTIL_USED_COMPONENTS` * `PackageManager.MATCH_DIRECT_BOOT_AUTO` * `PackageManager.MATCH_DIRECT_BOOT_AWARE` * `PackageManager.MATCH_DIRECT_BOOT_UNAWARE` * `PackageManager.MATCH_SYSTEM_ONLY` * `PackageManager.MATCH_UNINSTALLED_PACKAGES` * `PackageManager.GET_DISABLED_COMPONENTS` * `PackageManager.GET_DISABLED_UNTIL_USED_COMPONENTS` * `PackageManager.GET_UNINSTALLED_PACKAGES` * `PackageManager.GET_APP_LOCK_INFO` |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `ActivityInfo` | PackageManager.ActivityInfo |

**See also:**

* `resolveActivity(PackageManager)`

### resolveType

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public String resolveType (Context context)
```

Return the MIME data type of this intent. If the type field is
explicitly set, that is simply returned. Otherwise, if the data is set,
the type of that data is returned. If neither fields are set, a null is
returned.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `context` | `Context`: This value cannot be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `String` | The MIME type of this intent. |

### resolveType

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public String resolveType (ContentResolver resolver)
```

Return the MIME data type of this intent. If the type field is
explicitly set, that is simply returned. Otherwise, if the data is set,
the type of that data is returned. If neither fields are set, a null is
returned.

| Parameters | |

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public String resolveTypeIfNeeded (ContentResolver resolver)
```

Return the MIME data type of this intent, only if it will be needed for
intent resolution. This is not generally useful for application code;
it is used by the frameworks for communicating with back-end system
services.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `resolver` | `ContentResolver`: A ContentResolver that can be used to determine the MIME type of the intent's data.   This value cannot be `null`. |

### setAction

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Intent setAction (String action)
```

Set the general action to be performed.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |

```
public Intent setClass (Context packageContext, 
                Class<?> cls)
```

Convenience for calling `setComponent(ComponentName)` with the
name returned by a `Class` object.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `packageContext` | `Context`: A Context of the application package implementing this class.   This value cannot be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Intent` | Returns the same Intent object, for chaining multiple calls into a single statement.   This value cannot be `null`. |

**See also:**

* `setComponent(ComponentName)`

### setClassName

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Intent setClassName (String packageName, 
                String className)
```

Convenience for calling `setComponent(ComponentName)` with an
explicit application package name and class name.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `packageName` | `String`: The name of the package implementing the desired component.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `className` | `String`: The name of a class inside of the application package that will be used as the component for this Intent.   This value cannot be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Intent` | Returns the same Intent object, for chaining multiple calls into a single statement.   This value cannot be `null`. |

**See also:**

* `setComponent(ComponentName)`
* `setClass(Context, Class)`

### setClassName

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Intent setClassName (Context packageContext, 
                String className)
```

Convenience for calling `setComponent(ComponentName)` with an
explicit class name.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `packageContext` | `Context`: A Context of the application package implementing this class.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `className` | `String`: The name of a class inside of the application package that will be used as the component for this Intent.   This value cannot be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Intent` | Returns the same Intent object, for chaining multiple calls into a single statement.   This value cannot be `null`. |

**See also:**

* `setComponent(ComponentName)`
* `setClass(Context, Class)`

### setClipData

Added in [API level 16](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void setClipData (ClipData clip)
```

Set a `ClipData` associated with this Intent. This replaces any
previously set ClipData.

The ClipData in an intent is not used for Intent matching or other
such operations. Semantically it is like extras, used to transmit
additional data with the Intent. The main feature of using this over
the extras for data is that `FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION`
and `FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION` will operate on any URI
items included in the clip data. This is useful, in particular, if
you want to transmit an Intent containing multiple `content:`
URIs for which the recipient may not have global permission to access the
content provider.

If the ClipData contains items that are themselves Intents, any
grant flags in those Intents will be ignored. Only the top-level flags
of the main Intent are respected, and will be applied to all Uri or
Intent items in the clip (or sub-items of the clip).

The MIME type, label, and icon in the ClipData object are not
directly used by Intent. Applications should generally rely on the
MIME type of the Intent itself, not what it may find in the ClipData.
A common practice is to construct a ClipData for use with an Intent
with a MIME type of "\*/\*".

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `clip` | `ClipData`: The new clip to set. May be null to clear the current clip. |

### setComponent

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Intent setComponent (ComponentName component)
```

(Usually optional) Explicitly set the component to handle the intent.
If left with the default value of null, the system will determine the
appropriate class to use based on the other fields (action, data,
type, categories) in the Intent. If this class is defined, the
specified class will always be used regardless of the other fields. You
should only set this value when you know you absolutely want a specific
class to be used; otherwise it is better to let the system find the
appropriate class so that you will respect the installed applications
and user preferences.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `component` | `ComponentName`: The name of the application component to handle the intent, or null to let the system find one for you. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Intent` | Returns the same Intent object, for chaining multiple calls into a single statement. |

**See also:**

* `setClass(Context, Class)`
* `setClassName(Context,String)`
* `setClassName(String,String)`
* `getComponent()`
* `resolveActivity(PackageManager)`

### setData

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Intent setData (Uri data)
```

Set the data this intent is operating on. This method automatically
clears any type that was previously set by `setType(String)` or
`setTypeAndNormalize(String)`.

*Note: scheme matching in the Android framework is
case-sensitive, unlike the formal RFC. As a result,
you should always write your Uri with a lower case scheme,
or use `Uri.normalizeScheme` or
`setDataAndNormalize(Uri)`
to ensure that the scheme is converted to lower case.*

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `data` | `Uri`: The Uri of the data this intent is now targeting.   This value may be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Intent` | Returns the same Intent object, for chaining multiple calls into a single statement.   This value cannot be `null`. |

**See also:**

* `getData()`
* `setDataAndNormalize(Uri)`
* `Uri.normalizeScheme()`

### setDataAndNormalize

Added in [API level 16](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Intent setDataAndNormalize (Uri data)
```

Normalize and set the data this intent is operating on.

This method automatically clears any type that was
previously set (for example, by `setType(String)`).

The data Uri is normalized using
`Uri.normalizeScheme()` before it is set,
so really this is just a convenience method for

```
setData(data.normalize())
```

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `data` | `Uri`: The Uri of the data this intent is now targeting.   This value cannot be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Intent` | Returns the same Intent object, for chaining multiple calls into a single statement.   This value cannot be `null`. |

**See also:**

* `getData()`
* `setType(String)`
* `Uri.normalizeScheme()`

### setDataAndType

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Intent setDataAndType (Uri data, 
                String type)
```

(Usually optional) Set the data for the intent along with an explicit
MIME data type. This method should very rarely be used -- it allows you
to override the MIME type that would ordinarily be inferred from the
data with your own type given here.

*Note: MIME type and Uri scheme matching in the
Android framework is case-sensitive, unlike the formal RFC definitions.
As a result, you should always write these elements with lower case letters,
or use `normalizeMimeType(String)` or `Uri.normalizeScheme()` or
`setDataAndTypeAndNormalize(Uri, String)`
to ensure that they are converted to lower case.*

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `data` | `Uri`: The Uri of the data this intent is now targeting.   This value may be `null`. |
| `type` | `String`: The MIME type of the data being handled by this intent.   This value may be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Intent` | Returns the same Intent object, for chaining multiple calls into a single statement.   This value cannot be `null`. |

**See also:**

* `setType(String)`
* `setData(Uri)`
* `normalizeMimeType(String)`
* `Uri.normalizeScheme()`
* `setDataAndTypeAndNormalize(Uri, String)`

### setDataAndTypeAndNormalize

Added in [API level 16](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Intent setDataAndTypeAndNormalize (Uri data, 
                String type)
```

(Usually optional) Normalize and set both the data Uri and an explicit
MIME data type. This method should very rarely be used -- it allows you
to override the MIME type that would ordinarily be inferred from the
data with your own type given here.

The data Uri and the MIME type are normalize using
`Uri.normalizeScheme()` and `normalizeMimeType(String)`
before they are set, so really this is just a convenience method for

```
setDataAndType(data.normalize(), Intent.normalizeMimeType(type))
```

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `data` | `Uri`: The Uri of the data this intent is now targeting.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `type` | `String`: The MIME type of the data being handled by this intent.   This value may be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Intent` | Returns the same Intent object, for chaining multiple calls into a single statement.   This value cannot be `null`. |

**See also:**

* `setType(String)`
* `setData(Uri)`
* `setDataAndType(Uri, String)`
* `normalizeMimeType(String)`
* `Uri.normalizeScheme()`

### setExtrasClassLoader

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void setExtrasClassLoader (ClassLoader loader)
```

Sets the ClassLoader that will be used when unmarshalling
any Parcelable values from the extras of this Intent.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `loader` | `ClassLoader`: a ClassLoader, or null to use the default loader at the time of unmarshalling. |

### setFlags

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Intent setFlags (int flags)
```

Set special flags controlling how this intent is handled. Most values
here depend on the type of component being executed by the Intent,
specifically the FLAG\_ACTIVITY\_\* flags are all for use with
`Context.startActivity()` and the
FLAG\_RECEIVER\_\* flags are all for use with
`Context.sendBroadcast()`.

See the
[Tasks and Back
Stack](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/fundamentals/tasks-and-back-stack) documentation for important information on how some of these options impact
the behavior of your application.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `flags` | `int`: The desired flags.   Value is either `0` or a combination of the following:  * `FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION` * `FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION` * `FLAG_FROM_BACKGROUND` * `FLAG_DEBUG_LOG_RESOLUTION` * `FLAG_EXCLUDE_STOPPED_PACKAGES` * `FLAG_INCLUDE_STOPPED_PACKAGES` * `FLAG_GRANT_PERSISTABLE_URI_PERMISSION` * `FLAG_GRANT_PREFIX_URI_PERMISSION` * `FLAG_ACTIVITY_MATCH_EXTERNAL` * `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_HISTORY` * `FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP` * `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK` * `FLAG_ACTIVITY_MULTIPLE_TASK` * `FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP` * `FLAG_ACTIVITY_FORWARD_RESULT` * `FLAG_ACTIVITY_PREVIOUS_IS_TOP` * `FLAG_ACTIVITY_EXCLUDE_FROM_RECENTS` * `FLAG_ACTIVITY_BROUGHT_TO_FRONT` * `FLAG_ACTIVITY_RESET_TASK_IF_NEEDED` * `FLAG_ACTIVITY_LAUNCHED_FROM_HISTORY` * `FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_WHEN_TASK_RESET` * `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_DOCUMENT` * `FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_WHEN_TASK_RESET` * `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_USER_ACTION` * `FLAG_ACTIVITY_REORDER_TO_FRONT` * `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_ANIMATION` * `FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK` * `FLAG_ACTIVITY_TASK_ON_HOME` * `FLAG_ACTIVITY_RETAIN_IN_RECENTS` * `FLAG_ACTIVITY_LAUNCH_ADJACENT` * `FLAG_ACTIVITY_REQUIRE_NON_BROWSER` * `FLAG_ACTIVITY_REQUIRE_DEFAULT` * `FLAG_RECEIVER_REGISTERED_ONLY` * `FLAG_RECEIVER_REPLACE_PENDING` * `FLAG_RECEIVER_FOREGROUND` * `FLAG_RECEIVER_NO_ABORT` * `FLAG_RECEIVER_VISIBLE_TO_INSTANT_APPS` |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Intent` | Returns the same Intent object, for chaining multiple calls into a single statement.   This value cannot be `null`. |

**See also:**

* `getFlags()`
* `addFlags(int)`
* `removeFlags(int)`

### setIdentifier

Added in [API level 29](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Intent setIdentifier (String identifier)
```

Set an identifier for this Intent. If set, this provides a unique identity for this Intent,
allowing it to be unique from other Intents that would otherwise look the same. In
particular, this will be used by `filterEquals(Intent)` to determine if two
Intents are the same as with other fields like `setAction(String)`. However, unlike those
fields, the identifier is *never* used for matching against an `IntentFilter`;
it is as if the identifier has not been set on the Intent.

This can be used, for example, to make this Intent unique from other Intents that
are otherwise the same, for use in creating a `PendingIntent`. (Be aware
however that the receiver of the PendingIntent will see whatever you put in here.) The
structure of this string is completely undefined by the platform, however if you are going
to be exposing identifier strings across different applications you may need to define
your own structure if there is no central party defining the contents of this field.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `identifier` | `String`: The identifier for this Intent. The contents of the string have no meaning to the system, except whether they are exactly the same as another identifier.   This value may be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Intent` | Returns the same Intent object, for chaining multiple calls into a single statement.   This value cannot be `null`. |

**See also:**

* `getIdentifier()`

### setPackage

Added in [API level 4](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Intent setPackage (String packageName)
```

(Usually optional) Set an explicit application package name that limits
the components this Intent will resolve to. If left to the default
value of null, all components in all applications will considered.
If non-null, the Intent can only match the components in the given
application package.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `packageName` | `String`: The name of the application package to handle the intent, or null to allow any application package. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Intent` | Returns the same Intent object, for chaining multiple calls into a single statement. |

**See also:**

* `getPackage()`
* `resolveActivity(PackageManager)`

### setSelector

Added in [API level 15](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void setSelector (Intent selector)
```

Set a selector for this Intent. This is a modification to the kinds of
things the Intent will match. If the selector is set, it will be used
when trying to find entities that can handle the Intent, instead of the
main contents of the Intent. This allows you build an Intent containing
a generic protocol while targeting it more specifically.

An example of where this may be used is with things like
`CATEGORY_APP_BROWSER`. This category allows you to build an
Intent that will launch the Browser application. However, the correct
main entry point of an application is actually `ACTION_MAIN`
`CATEGORY_LAUNCHER` with `setComponent(ComponentName)`
used to specify the actual Activity to launch. If you launch the browser
with something different, undesired behavior may happen if the user has
previously or later launches it the normal way, since they do not match.
Instead, you can build an Intent with the MAIN action (but no ComponentName
yet specified) and set a selector with `ACTION_MAIN` and
`CATEGORY_APP_BROWSER` to point it specifically to the browser activity.

Setting a selector does not impact the behavior of
`filterEquals(Intent)` and `filterHashCode()`. This is part of the
desired behavior of a selector -- it does not impact the base meaning
of the Intent, just what kinds of things will be matched against it
when determining who can handle it.

You can not use both a selector and `setPackage(String)` on
the same base Intent.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `selector` | `Intent`: The desired selector Intent; set to null to not use a special selector. |

### setSourceBounds

Added in [API level 7](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void setSourceBounds (Rect r)
```

Set the bounds of the sender of this intent, in screen coordinates. This can be
used as a hint to the receiver for animations and the like. Null means that there
is no source bounds.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `r` | `Rect`: This value may be `null`. |

### setType

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Intent setType (String type)
```

Set an explicit MIME data type.

This is used to create intents that only specify a type and not data,
for example to indicate the type of data to return.

This method automatically clears any data that was
previously set (for example by `setData(Uri)`).

*Note: MIME type matching in the Android framework is
case-sensitive, unlike formal RFC MIME types. As a result,
you should always write your MIME types with lower case letters,
or use `normalizeMimeType(String)` or `setTypeAndNormalize(String)`
to ensure that it is converted to lower case.*

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `type` | `String`: The MIME type of the data being handled by this intent.   This value may be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Intent` | Returns the same Intent object, for chaining multiple calls into a single statement.   This value cannot be `null`. |

**See also:**

* `getType()`
* `setTypeAndNormalize(String)`
* `setDataAndType(Uri, String)`
* `normalizeMimeType(String)`

### setTypeAndNormalize

Added in [API level 16](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Intent setTypeAndNormalize (String type)
```

Normalize and set an explicit MIME data type.

This is used to create intents that only specify a type and not data,
for example to indicate the type of data to return.

This method automatically clears any data that was
previously set (for example by `setData(Uri)`).

The MIME type is normalized using
`normalizeMimeType(String)` before it is set,
so really this is just a convenience method for

```
setType(Intent.normalizeMimeType(type))
```

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `type` | `String`: The MIME type of the data being handled by this intent.   This value may be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Intent` | Returns the same Intent object, for chaining multiple calls into a single statement.   This value cannot be `null`. |

**See also:**

* `getType()`
* `setData(Uri)`
* `normalizeMimeType(String)`

### toString

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public String toString ()
```

Returns a string representation of the object.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `String` | a string representation of the object. |

### toURI

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
15](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public String toURI ()
```

**This method was deprecated
in API level 15.**  
Use `toUri(int)` instead.

Call `toUri(int)` with 0 flags.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `String` |  |

### toUri

Added in [API level 4](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public String toUri (int flags)
```

Convert this Intent into a String holding a URI representation of it.
The returned URI string has been properly URI encoded, so it can be
used with `Uri.parse(String)`. The URI contains the
Intent's data as the base URI, with an additional fragment describing
the action, categories, type, flags, package, component, and extras.

You can convert the returned string back to an Intent with
`getIntent(String)`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `flags` | `int`: Additional operating flags.   Value is either `0` or a combination of the following:  * `URI_ALLOW_UNSAFE` * `URI_ANDROID_APP_SCHEME` * `URI_INTENT_SCHEME` |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `String` | Returns a URI encoding URI string describing the entire contents of the Intent. |

### writeToParcel

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void writeToParcel (Parcel out, 
                int flags)
```

Flatten this object in to a Parcel.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `out` | `Parcel`: The Parcel in which the object should be written.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `flags` | `int`: Additional flags about how the object should be written. May be 0 or `Parcelable.PARCELABLE_WRITE_RETURN_VALUE`.   Value is either `0` or a combination of the following:  * `Parcelable.PARCELABLE_WRITE_RETURN_VALUE` |
