An activity is a single, focused thing that the user can do. Almost all
activities interact with the user, so the Activity class takes care of
creating a window for you in which you can place your UI with
`setContentView(View)`. While activities are often presented to the user
as full-screen windows, they can also be used in other ways: as floating
windows (via a theme with `R.attr.windowIsFloating` set),
[Multi-Window mode](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/multi-window) or embedded into other windows.
There are two methods almost all subclasses of Activity will implement:

* `onCreate(Bundle)` is where you initialize your activity. Most
  importantly, here you will usually call `setContentView(int)`
  with a layout resource defining your UI, and using `findViewById(int)`
  to retrieve the widgets in that UI that you need to interact with
  programmatically.* `onPause()` is where you deal with the user pausing active
    interaction with the activity. Any changes made by the user should at
    this point be committed (usually to the
    `ContentProvider` holding the data). In this
    state the activity is still visible on screen.

To be of use with `Context.startActivity()`, all
activity classes must have a corresponding
`<activity>`
declaration in their package's `AndroidManifest.xml`.

### Developer Guides

The Activity class is an important part of an application's overall lifecycle,
and the way activities are launched and put together is a fundamental
part of the platform's application model. For a detailed perspective on the structure of an
Android application and how activities behave, please read the
[Application Fundamentals](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/fundamentals) and
[Tasks and Back Stack](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/tasks-and-back-stack)
developer guides.

You can also find a detailed discussion about how to create activities in the
[Activities](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities)
developer guide.



### Fragments

The `FragmentActivity` subclass
can make use of the `Fragment` class to better
modularize their code, build more sophisticated user interfaces for larger
screens, and help scale their application between small and large screens.

For more information about using fragments, read the
[Fragments](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments) developer guide.



### Activity Lifecycle

Activities in the system are managed as
[activity stacks](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/tasks-and-back-stack). When a new activity is started, it is usually placed on the top of the
current stack and becomes the running activity -- the previous activity always remains
below it in the stack, and will not come to the foreground again until
the new activity exits. There can be one or multiple activity stacks visible
on screen.

An activity has essentially four states:

* If an activity is in the foreground of the screen (at the highest position of the topmost
  stack), it is *active* or *running*. This is usually the activity that the
  user is currently interacting with.
* If an activity has lost focus but is still presented to the user, it is *visible*.
  It is possible if a new non-full-sized or transparent activity has focus on top of your
  activity, another activity has higher position in multi-window mode, or the activity
  itself is not focusable in current windowing mode. Such activity is completely alive (it
  maintains all state and member information and remains attached to the window manager).* If an activity is completely obscured by another activity,
    it is *stopped* or *hidden*. It still retains all state and member
    information, however, it is no longer visible to the user so its window is hidden
    and it will often be killed by the system when memory is needed elsewhere.
  * The system can drop the activity from memory by either asking it to finish,
    or simply killing its process, making it *destroyed*. When it is displayed again
    to the user, it must be completely restarted and restored to its previous state.

The following diagram shows the important state paths of an activity.
The square rectangles represent callback methods you can implement to
perform operations when the activity moves between states. The colored
ovals are major states the activity can be in.

![State diagram for the Android activity lifecycle.](https://developer.android.com/images/activity_lifecycle.png)

There are three key loops you may be interested in monitoring within your
activity:

* The **entire lifetime** of an activity happens between the first call
  to `onCreate(Bundle)` through to a single final call
  to `onDestroy()`. An activity will do all setup
  of "global" state in onCreate(), and release all remaining resources in
  onDestroy(). For example, if it has a thread running in the background
  to download data from the network, it may create that thread in onCreate()
  and then stop the thread in onDestroy().* The **visible lifetime** of an activity happens between a call to
    `onStart()` until a corresponding call to
    `onStop()`. During this time the user can see the
    activity on-screen, though it may not be in the foreground and interacting
    with the user. Between these two methods you can maintain resources that
    are needed to show the activity to the user. For example, you can register
    a `BroadcastReceiver` in onStart() to monitor for changes
    that impact your UI, and unregister it in onStop() when the user no
    longer sees what you are displaying. The onStart() and onStop() methods
    can be called multiple times, as the activity becomes visible and hidden
    to the user.* The **foreground lifetime** of an activity happens between a call to
      `onResume()` until a corresponding call to
      `onPause()`. During this time the activity is
      visible, active and interacting with the user. An activity
      can frequently go between the resumed and paused states -- for example when
      the device goes to sleep, when an activity result is delivered, when a new
      intent is delivered -- so the code in these methods should be fairly
      lightweight.

The entire lifecycle of an activity is defined by the following
Activity methods. All of these are hooks that you can override
to do appropriate work when the activity changes state. All
activities will implement `onCreate(Bundle)`
to do their initial setup; many will also implement
`onPause()` to commit changes to data and
prepare to pause interacting with the user, and `onStop()`
to handle no longer being visible on screen. You should always
call up to your superclass when implementing these methods.

```
public class Activity extends ApplicationContext {
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState);

    protected void onStart();

    protected void onRestart();

    protected void onResume();

    protected void onPause();

    protected void onStop();

    protected void onDestroy();
}
```

In general the movement through an activity's lifecycle looks like
this:

| Method | | | Description | Killable? | Next |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `onCreate()` | | | Called when the activity is first created. This is where you should do all of your normal static set up: create views, bind data to lists, etc. This method also provides you with a Bundle containing the activity's previously frozen state, if there was one. Always followed by `onStart()`. | No | `onStart()` |
|  | `onRestart()` | | Called after your activity has been stopped, prior to it being started again. Always followed by `onStart()` | No | `onStart()` |
| `onStart()` | | Called when the activity is becoming visible to the user. Followed by `onResume()` if the activity comes to the foreground, or `onStop()` if it becomes hidden. | No | `onResume()` or `onStop()` |
|  | `onResume()` | Called when the activity will start interacting with the user. At this point your activity is at the top of its activity stack, with user input going to it. Always followed by `onPause()`. | No | `onPause()` |
| `onPause()` | Called when the activity loses foreground state, is no longer focusable or before transition to stopped/hidden or destroyed state. The activity is still visible to user, so it's recommended to keep it visually active and continue updating the UI. Implementations of this method must be very quick because the next activity will not be resumed until this method returns. Followed by either `onResume()` if the activity returns back to the front, or `onStop()` if it becomes invisible to the user. | **Pre-`Build.VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB`** | `onResume()` or  `onStop()` |
| `onStop()` | | Called when the activity is no longer visible to the user. This may happen either because a new activity is being started on top, an existing one is being brought in front of this one, or this one is being destroyed. This is typically used to stop animations and refreshing the UI, etc. Followed by either `onRestart()` if this activity is coming back to interact with the user, or `onDestroy()` if this activity is going away. | **Yes** | `onRestart()` or  `onDestroy()` |
| `onDestroy()` | | | The final call you receive before your activity is destroyed. This can happen either because the activity is finishing (someone called `Activity.finish` on it), or because the system is temporarily destroying this instance of the activity to save space. You can distinguish between these two scenarios with the `Activity.isFinishing` method. | **Yes** | *nothing* |

Note the "Killable" column in the above table -- for those methods that
are marked as being killable, after that method returns the process hosting the
activity may be killed by the system *at any time* without another line
of its code being executed. Because of this, you should use the
`onPause()` method to write any persistent data (such as user edits)
to storage. In addition, the method
`onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)` is called before placing the activity
in such a background state, allowing you to save away any dynamic instance
state in your activity into the given Bundle, to be later received in
`onCreate(Bundle)` if the activity needs to be re-created.
See the [Process Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#ProcessLifecycle)
section for more information on how the lifecycle of a process is tied
to the activities it is hosting. Note that it is important to save
persistent data in `onPause()` instead of `onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)`
because the latter is not part of the lifecycle callbacks, so will not
be called in every situation as described in its documentation.

Be aware that these semantics will change slightly between
applications targeting platforms starting with `Build.VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB`
vs. those targeting prior platforms. Starting with Honeycomb, an application
is not in the killable state until its `onStop()` has returned. This
impacts when `onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)` may be called (it may be
safely called after `onPause()`) and allows an application to safely
wait until `onStop()` to save persistent state.

For applications targeting platforms starting with
`Build.VERSION_CODES.P` `onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)`
will always be called after `onStop()`, so an application may safely
perform fragment transactions in `onStop()` and will be able to save
persistent state later.

For those methods that are not marked as being killable, the activity's
process will not be killed by the system starting from the time the method
is called and continuing after it returns. Thus an activity is in the killable
state, for example, between after `onStop()` to the start of
`onResume()`. Keep in mind that under extreme memory pressure the
system can kill the application process at any time.



### Configuration Changes

If the configuration of the device (as defined by the
`Resources.Configuration` class) changes,
then anything displaying a user interface will need to update to match that
configuration. Because Activity is the primary mechanism for interacting
with the user, it includes special support for handling configuration
changes.

Unless you specify otherwise, a configuration change (such as a change
in screen orientation, language, input devices, etc.) will cause your
current activity to be *destroyed*, going through the normal activity
lifecycle process of `onPause()`,
`onStop()`, and `onDestroy()` as appropriate. If the activity
had been in the foreground or visible to the user, once `onDestroy()` is
called in that instance then a new instance of the activity will be
created, with whatever savedInstanceState the previous instance had generated
from `onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)`.

This is done because any application resource,
including layout files, can change based on any configuration value. Thus
the only safe way to handle a configuration change is to re-retrieve all
resources, including layouts, drawables, and strings. Because activities
must already know how to save their state and re-create themselves from
that state, this is a convenient way to have an activity restart itself
with a new configuration.

In some special cases, you may want to bypass restarting of your
activity based on one or more types of configuration changes. This is
done with the `android:configChanges`
attribute in its manifest. For any types of configuration changes you say
that you handle there, you will receive a call to your current activity's
`onConfigurationChanged(Configuration)` method instead of being restarted. If
a configuration change involves any that you do not handle, however, the
activity will still be restarted and `onConfigurationChanged(Configuration)`
will not be called.



### Starting Activities and Getting Results

The `startActivity(Intent)`
method is used to start a
new activity, which will be placed at the top of the activity stack. It
takes a single argument, an `Intent`,
which describes the activity
to be executed.

Sometimes you want to get a result back from an activity when it
ends. For example, you may start an activity that lets the user pick
a person in a list of contacts; when it ends, it returns the person
that was selected. To do this, you call the
`android.app.Activity.startActivityForResult(Intent,int)`
version with a second integer parameter identifying the call. The result
will come back through your `onActivityResult(int, int, Intent)`
method.

When an activity exits, it can call
`setResult(int)`
to return data back to its parent. It must always supply a result code,
which can be the standard results RESULT\_CANCELED, RESULT\_OK, or any
custom values starting at RESULT\_FIRST\_USER. In addition, it can optionally
return back an Intent containing any additional data it wants. All of this
information appears back on the
parent's `Activity.onActivityResult()`, along with the integer
identifier it originally supplied.

If a child activity fails for any reason (such as crashing), the parent
activity will receive a result with the code RESULT\_CANCELED.

```
public class MyActivity extends Activity {
    ...

    static final int PICK_CONTACT_REQUEST = 0;

    public boolean onKeyDown(int keyCode, KeyEvent event) {
        if (keyCode == KeyEvent.KEYCODE_DPAD_CENTER) {
            // When the user center presses, let them pick a contact.
            startActivityForResult(
                new Intent(Intent.ACTION_PICK,
                new Uri("content://contacts")),
                PICK_CONTACT_REQUEST);
           return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode,
            Intent data) {
        if (requestCode == PICK_CONTACT_REQUEST) {
            if (resultCode == RESULT_OK) {
                // A contact was picked.  Here we will just display it
                // to the user.
                startActivity(new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, data));
            }
        }
    }
}
```




### Saving Persistent State

There are generally two kinds of persistent state that an activity
will deal with: shared document-like data (typically stored in a SQLite
database using a [content provider](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ContentProvider))
and internal state such as user preferences.

For content provider data, we suggest that activities use an
"edit in place" user model. That is, any edits a user makes are effectively
made immediately without requiring an additional confirmation step.
Supporting this model is generally a simple matter of following two rules:

* When creating a new document, the backing database entry or file for
  it is created immediately. For example, if the user chooses to write
  a new email, a new entry for that email is created as soon as they
  start entering data, so that if they go to any other activity after
  that point this email will now appear in the list of drafts.

  * When an activity's `onPause()` method is called, it should
    commit to the backing content provider or file any changes the user
    has made. This ensures that those changes will be seen by any other
    activity that is about to run. You will probably want to commit
    your data even more aggressively at key times during your
    activity's lifecycle: for example before starting a new
    activity, before finishing your own activity, when the user
    switches between input fields, etc.

This model is designed to prevent data loss when a user is navigating
between activities, and allows the system to safely kill an activity (because
system resources are needed somewhere else) at any time after it has been
stopped (or paused on platform versions before `Build.VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB`).
Note this implies that the user pressing BACK from your activity does *not*
mean "cancel" -- it means to leave the activity with its current contents
saved away. Canceling edits in an activity must be provided through
some other mechanism, such as an explicit "revert" or "undo" option.

See the [content package](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ContentProvider) for
more information about content providers. These are a key aspect of how
different activities invoke and propagate data between themselves.

The Activity class also provides an API for managing internal persistent state
associated with an activity. This can be used, for example, to remember
the user's preferred initial display in a calendar (day view or week view)
or the user's default home page in a web browser.

Activity persistent state is managed
with the method `getPreferences(int)`,
allowing you to retrieve and
modify a set of name/value pairs associated with the activity. To use
preferences that are shared across multiple application components
(activities, receivers, services, providers), you can use the underlying
`Context.getSharedPreferences()` method
to retrieve a preferences
object stored under a specific name.
(Note that it is not possible to share settings data across application
packages -- for that you will need a content provider.)

Here is an excerpt from a calendar activity that stores the user's
preferred view mode in its persistent settings:

```
public class CalendarActivity extends Activity {
    ...

    static final int DAY_VIEW_MODE = 0;
    static final int WEEK_VIEW_MODE = 1;

    private SharedPreferences mPrefs;
    private int mCurViewMode;

    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

        mPrefs = getSharedPreferences(getLocalClassName(), MODE_PRIVATE);
        mCurViewMode = mPrefs.getInt("view_mode", DAY_VIEW_MODE);
    }

    protected void onPause() {
        super.onPause();

        SharedPreferences.Editor ed = mPrefs.edit();
        ed.putInt("view_mode", mCurViewMode);
        ed.commit();
    }
}
```




### Permissions

The ability to start a particular Activity can be enforced when it is
declared in its
manifest's `<activity>`
tag. By doing so, other applications will need to declare a corresponding
`<uses-permission>`
element in their own manifest to be able to start that activity.

When starting an Activity you can set `Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION` and/or `Intent.FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION` on the Intent. This will grant the
Activity access to the specific URIs in the Intent. Access will remain
until the Activity has finished (it will remain across the hosting
process being killed and other temporary destruction). As of
`Build.VERSION_CODES.GINGERBREAD`, if the Activity
was already created and a new Intent is being delivered to
`onNewIntent(Intent)`, any newly granted URI permissions will be added
to the existing ones it holds.

See the [Security and Permissions](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/security/security)
document for more information on permissions and security in general.


### Process Lifecycle

The Android system attempts to keep an application process around for as
long as possible, but eventually will need to remove old processes when
memory runs low. As described in [Activity
Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#ActivityLifecycle), the decision about which process to remove is intimately
tied to the state of the user's interaction with it. In general, there
are four states a process can be in based on the activities running in it,
listed here in order of importance. The system will kill less important
processes (the last ones) before it resorts to killing more important
processes (the first ones).

1. The **foreground activity** (the activity at the top of the screen
   that the user is currently interacting with) is considered the most important.
   Its process will only be killed as a last resort, if it uses more memory
   than is available on the device. Generally at this point the device has
   reached a memory paging state, so this is required in order to keep the user
   interface responsive.- A **visible activity** (an activity that is visible to the user
     but not in the foreground, such as one sitting behind a foreground dialog
     or next to other activities in multi-window mode)
     is considered extremely important and will not be killed unless that is
     required to keep the foreground activity running.- A **background activity** (an activity that is not visible to
       the user and has been stopped) is no longer critical, so the system may
       safely kill its process to reclaim memory for other foreground or
       visible processes. If its process needs to be killed, when the user navigates
       back to the activity (making it visible on the screen again), its
       `onCreate(Bundle)` method will be called with the savedInstanceState it had previously
       supplied in `onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)` so that it can restart itself in the same
       state as the user last left it.- An **empty process** is one hosting no activities or other
         application components (such as `Service` or
         `BroadcastReceiver` classes). These are killed very
         quickly by the system as memory becomes low. For this reason, any
         background operation you do outside of an activity must be executed in the
         context of an activity BroadcastReceiver or Service to ensure that the system
         knows it needs to keep your process around.

Sometimes an Activity may need to do a long-running operation that exists
independently of the activity lifecycle itself. An example may be a camera
application that allows you to upload a picture to a web site. The upload
may take a long time, and the application should allow the user to leave
the application while it is executing. To accomplish this, your Activity
should start a `Service` in which the upload takes place. This allows
the system to properly prioritize your process (considering it to be more
important than other non-visible applications) for the duration of the
upload, independent of whether the original activity is paused, stopped,
or finished.

                PrintWriter writer, 
                String[] args)
```

Print the Activity's state into the given stream. This gets invoked if
you run `adb shell dumpsys activity <activity_component_name>`.

This method won't be called if the app targets
`Build.VERSION_CODES.TIRAMISU` or later if the dump request starts with one

```
public void enterPictureInPictureMode ()
```

Puts the activity in picture-in-picture mode if possible in the current system state. Any
prior calls to `setPictureInPictureParams(PictureInPictureParams)` will still apply
when entering picture-in-picture through this call.

**See also:**

* `enterPictureInPictureMode(PictureInPictureParams)`
* `R.attr.supportsPictureInPicture`

### findViewById

```
public T findViewById (int id)
```

Finds a view that was identified by the `android:id` XML attribute
that was processed in `onCreate(Bundle)`.

**Note:** In most cases -- depending on compiler support --
the resulting view is automatically cast to the target class type. If
the target class type is unconstrained, an explicit cast may be
necessary.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | `int`: the ID to search for |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `T` | a view with given ID if found, or `null` otherwise |

onActivityResult().

### finishActivity

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void finishActivity (int requestCode)
```

Force finish another activity that you had previously started with
`startActivityForResult(Intent, int)`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `requestCode` | `int`: The request code of the activity that you had given to startActivityForResult(). If there are multiple activities started with this request code, they will all be finished. |

### finishActivityFromChild

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
30](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void finishActivityFromChild (Activity child, 
                int requestCode)
```

**This method was deprecated
in API level 30.**  
Use `finishActivity(int)` instead.

This is called when a child activity of this one calls its
finishActivity().

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `child` | `Activity`: The activity making the call.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `requestCode` | `int`: Request code that had been used to start the activity. |

### finishAffinity

Added in [API level 16](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void finishAffinity ()
```

Finish this activity as well as all activities immediately below it
in the current task that have the same affinity. This is typically
used when an application can be launched on to another task (such as
from an ACTION\_VIEW of a content type it understands) and the user
has used the up navigation to switch out of the current task and in
to its own task. In this case, if the user has navigated down into
any other activities of the second application, all of those should
be removed from the original task as part of the task switch.

Note that this finish does *not* allow you to deliver results
to the previous activity, and an exception will be thrown if you are trying
to do so.

### finishAfterTransition

Added in [API level 21](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void finishAfterTransition ()
```

Reverses the Activity Scene entry Transition and triggers the calling Activity
to reverse its exit Transition. When the exit Transition completes,
`finish()` is called. If no entry Transition was used, finish() is called
immediately and the Activity exit Transition is run.

**See also:**

* `android.app.ActivityOptions.makeSceneTransitionAnimation(Activity,android.util.Pair[])`

### finishAndRemoveTask

Added in [API level 21](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void finishAndRemoveTask ()
```

Call this when your activity is done and should be closed and the task should be completely
removed as a part of finishing the root activity of the task.

### finishFromChild

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
30](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void finishFromChild (Activity child)
```

**This method was deprecated
in API level 30.**  
Use `finish()` instead.

This is called when a child activity of this one calls its
`finish()` method. The default implementation simply calls
finish() on this activity (the parent), finishing the entire group.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `child` | `Activity`: The activity making the call. |

**See also:**

* `finish()`

### getActionBar

Added in [API level 11](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public ActionBar getActionBar ()
```

Retrieve a reference to this activity's ActionBar.

```
public final Application getApplication ()
```

Return the application that owns this activity.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Application` |  |

### getCaller

Added in [API level 35](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public ComponentCaller getCaller ()
```

Returns the ComponentCaller instance of the app that started this activity.

To keep the ComponentCaller instance for future use, call
`setIntent(Intent,ComponentCaller)`, and use this method to retrieve it.

Note that in `onNewIntent(Intent)`, this method will return the original ComponentCaller.
You can use `setIntent(Intent,ComponentCaller)` to update it to the new
ComponentCaller.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `ComponentCaller` | `ComponentCaller` instance corresponding to the intent from `getIntent()`, or `null` if the activity was not launched with that intent |

**See also:**

* `ComponentCaller`
* `getIntent()`
* `setIntent(Intent,ComponentCaller)`

### getCallingActivity

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public ComponentName getCallingActivity ()
```

Return the name of the activity that invoked this activity. This is
who the data in `setResult()` will be sent to. You
can use this information to validate that the recipient is allowed to
receive the data.

Note: if the calling activity is not expecting a result (that is it
did not use the `startActivityForResult(Intent, int)`
form that includes a request code), then the calling package will be
null.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `ComponentName` | The ComponentName of the activity that will receive your reply, or null if none. |

### getCallingPackage

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public String getCallingPackage ()
```

Return the name of the package that invoked this activity. This is who
the data in `setResult()` will be sent to. You can
use this information to validate that the recipient is allowed to
receive the data.

Note: if the calling activity is not expecting a result (that is it
did not use the `startActivityForResult(Intent, int)`
form that includes a request code), then the calling package will be
null.

Note: prior to `Build.VERSION_CODES.JELLY_BEAN_MR2`,
the result from this method was unstable. If the process hosting the calling
package was no longer running, it would return null instead of the proper package
name. You can use `getCallingActivity()` and retrieve the package name
from that instead.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `String` | The package of the activity that will receive your reply, or null if none. |

### getChangingConfigurations

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public int getChangingConfigurations ()
```

If this activity is being destroyed because it can not handle a
configuration parameter being changed (and thus its
`onConfigurationChanged(Configuration)` method is
*not* being called), then you can use this method to discover
the set of changes that have occurred while in the process of being
destroyed. Note that there is no guarantee that these will be
accurate (other changes could have happened at any time), so you should
only use this as an optimization hint.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `int` | Returns a bit field of the configuration parameters that are changing, as defined by the `Configuration` class. |

### getComponentName

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public ComponentName getComponentName ()
```

Returns the complete component name of this activity.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `ComponentName` | Returns the complete component name for this activity |

### getContentScene

Added in [API level 21](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Scene getContentScene ()
```

Retrieve the `Scene` representing this window's current content.
Requires `Window.FEATURE_CONTENT_TRANSITIONS`.

This method will return null if the current content is not represented by a Scene.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Scene` | Current Scene being shown or null |

### getContentTransitionManager

Added in [API level 21](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public TransitionManager getContentTransitionManager ()
```

Retrieve the `TransitionManager` responsible for default transitions in this window.
Requires `Window.FEATURE_CONTENT_TRANSITIONS`.

This method will return non-null after content has been initialized (e.g. by using
`setContentView(View)`) if `Window.FEATURE_CONTENT_TRANSITIONS` has been granted.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `TransitionManager` | This window's content TransitionManager or null if none is set. |

### getCurrentCaller

Added in [API level 35](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public ComponentCaller getCurrentCaller ()
```

Returns the ComponentCaller instance of the app that re-launched this activity with a new
intent via `onNewIntent(Intent)` or `onActivityResult(int, int, Intent)`.

Note that this method only works within the `onNewIntent(Intent)` and
`onActivityResult(int, int, Intent)` methods. If you call this method outside `onNewIntent(Intent)` and
`onActivityResult(int, int, Intent)`, it will throw an `IllegalStateException`.

You can also retrieve the caller if you override
`onNewIntent(Intent,ComponentCaller)` or
`onActivityResult(int,int,Intent,ComponentCaller)`.

To keep the ComponentCaller instance for future use, call
`setIntent(Intent,ComponentCaller)`, and use `getCaller()` to retrieve it.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `ComponentCaller` | `ComponentCaller` instance.   This value cannot be `null`. |

| Throws | |
| --- | --- |
| `IllegalStateException` | if the caller is `null`, indicating the method was called outside `onNewIntent(Intent)` |

**See also:**

* `ComponentCaller`
* `setIntent(Intent,ComponentCaller)`
* `getCaller()`

### getCurrentFocus

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public View getCurrentFocus ()
```

Calls `Window.getCurrentFocus()` on the
Window of this Activity to return the currently focused view.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `View` | View The current View with focus or null. |

**See also:**

* `getWindow()`
* `Window.getCurrentFocus()`

### getFragmentManager

Added in [API level 11](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
28](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public FragmentManager getFragmentManager ()
```

**This method was deprecated
in API level 28.**  
Use `FragmentActivity.getSupportFragmentManager()`

Return the FragmentManager for interacting with fragments associated
with this activity.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `FragmentManager` |  |

### getInitialCaller

Added in [API level 35](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public ComponentCaller getInitialCaller ()
```

Returns the ComponentCaller instance of the app that initially launched this activity.

Note that calls to `onNewIntent(Intent)` and `setIntent(Intent)` have no effect on the
returned value of this method.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `ComponentCaller` | `ComponentCaller` instance.   This value cannot be `null`. |

**See also:**

* `ComponentCaller`

### getIntent

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Intent getIntent ()
```

Returns the intent that started this activity.

To keep the Intent instance for future use, call `setIntent(Intent)`, and use
this method to retrieve it.

Note that in `onNewIntent(Intent)`, this method will return the original Intent. You can
use `setIntent(Intent)` to update it to the new Intent.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Intent` | `Intent` instance that started this activity, or that was kept for future use |

### getLastNonConfigurationInstance

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Object getLastNonConfigurationInstance ()
```

Retrieve the non-configuration instance data that was previously
returned by `onRetainNonConfigurationInstance()`. This will
be available from the initial `onCreate(Bundle)` and
`onStart()` calls to the new instance, allowing you to extract
any useful dynamic state from the previous instance.

Note that the data you retrieve here should *only* be used
as an optimization for handling configuration changes. You should always
be able to handle getting a null pointer back, and an activity must
still be able to restore itself to its previous state (through the
normal `onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)` mechanism) even if this
function returns null.

**Note:** For most cases you should use the `Fragment` API
`Fragment.setRetainInstance(boolean)` instead; this is also
available on older platforms through the Android support libraries.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Object` | the object previously returned by `onRetainNonConfigurationInstance()` |

### getLaunchedFromPackage

Added in [API level 34](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public String getLaunchedFromPackage ()
```

Returns the package name of the app that initially launched this activity.

In order to receive the launching app's package name, at least one of the following has
to be met:

* The app must call `ActivityOptions.setShareIdentityEnabled(boolean)` with a
  value of `true` and launch this activity with the resulting
  `ActivityOptions`.* The launched activity has the same uid as the launching app.* The launched activity is running in a package that is signed with the same key
      used to sign the platform (typically only system packages such as Settings will
      meet this requirement).* Starting in `Build.VERSION_CODES.CINNAMON_BUN`, the activity was launched
        directly with `Activity.startActivityForResult(Intent,int)`.

.
These are the same requirements for `getLaunchedFromUid()`; if any of these are
met, then these methods can be used to obtain the uid and package name of the launching
app. If none are met, then `null` is returned.

Note, if an activity is launched via `startActivityForResult(Intent,int)` but the
launch is intercepted and forwarded by an intermediate app using `Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_FORWARD_RESULT`, the identity of the intermediate app will not be
implicitly shared. In this forwarding scenario, the intermediate app must explicitly
opt-in using `ActivityOptions.setShareIdentityEnabled(boolean)`.

Prior to `Build.VERSION_CODES.CINNAMON_BUN`, the launching app's identity
was not implicitly shared for any result-based launches and could only be retrieved via
`getCallingPackage()`

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `String` | the package name of the launching app or null if the current activity cannot access the identity of the launching app |

**See also:**

* `ActivityOptions.setShareIdentityEnabled(boolean)`
* `getLaunchedFromUid()`

### getLaunchedFromUid

Added in [API level 34](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public int getLaunchedFromUid ()
```

Returns the uid of the app that initially launched this activity.

In order to receive the launching app's uid, at least one of the following has to
be met:

* The app must call `ActivityOptions.setShareIdentityEnabled(boolean)` with a
  value of `true` and launch this activity with the resulting `ActivityOptions`.* The launched activity has the same uid as the launching app.* The launched activity is running in a package that is signed with the same key
      used to sign the platform (typically only system packages such as Settings will
      meet this requirement).* Starting in `Build.VERSION_CODES.CINNAMON_BUN`, the activity was launched
        directly with `Activity.startActivityForResult(Intent,int)`.

.
These are the same requirements for `getLaunchedFromPackage()`; if any of these are
met, then these methods can be used to obtain the uid and package name of the launching
app. If none are met, then `Process.INVALID_UID` is returned.

Note, if an activity is launched via `startActivityForResult(Intent,int)` but the
launch is intercepted and forwarded by an intermediate app using `Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_FORWARD_RESULT`, the identity of the intermediate app will not be
implicitly shared. In this forwarding scenario, the intermediate app must explicitly
opt-in using `ActivityOptions.setShareIdentityEnabled(boolean)`.

Prior to `Build.VERSION_CODES.CINNAMON_BUN`, the launching app's identity
was not implicitly shared for any result-based launches and could only be retrieved via
`getCallingPackage()`

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `int` | the uid of the launching app or `Process.INVALID_UID` if the current activity cannot access the identity of the launching app |

**See also:**

* `ActivityOptions.setShareIdentityEnabled(boolean)`
* `getLaunchedFromPackage()`

### getParentActivityIntent

Added in [API level 16](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Intent getParentActivityIntent ()
```

Obtain an `Intent` that will launch an explicit target activity specified by
this activity's logical parent. The logical parent is named in the application's manifest
by the `parentActivityName` attribute.
Activity subclasses may override this method to modify the Intent returned by
super.getParentActivityIntent() or to implement a different mechanism of retrieving
the parent intent entirely.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Intent` | a new Intent targeting the defined parent of this activity or null if there is no valid parent. |

### getPreferences

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public SharedPreferences getPreferences (int mode)
```

Retrieve a `SharedPreferences` object for accessing preferences
that are private to this activity. This simply calls the underlying
`getSharedPreferences(String,int)` method by passing in this activity's
class name as the preferences name.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `mode` | `int`: Operating mode. Use `Context.MODE_PRIVATE` for the default operation.   Value is either `0` or a combination of the following:  * `Context.MODE_PRIVATE` * `Context.MODE_WORLD_READABLE` * `Context.MODE_WORLD_WRITEABLE` * `Context.MODE_MULTI_PROCESS` |

### getReferrer

Added in [API level 22](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Uri getReferrer ()
```

Return information about who launched this activity. If the launching Intent
contains an `Intent.EXTRA_REFERRER`,
that will be returned as-is; otherwise, if known, an
`android-app:` referrer URI containing the
package name that started the Intent will be returned. This may return null if no
referrer can be identified -- it is neither explicitly specified, nor is it known which
application package was involved.

If called while inside the handling of `onNewIntent(Intent)`, this function will
return the referrer that submitted that new intent to the activity only after
`setIntent(Intent)` is called with the provided intent.

Note that this is *not* a security feature -- you can not trust the
referrer information, applications can spoof it.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Uri` |  |

### getRequestedOrientation

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

requested in the app manifest or the last orientation given to
`setRequestedOrientation(int)`.
**Note:**

* To improve the layout of apps on form factors with smallest width >= 600dp, the
  system ignores calls to this method for apps that target Android 16 (API level
  36) or higher.
* Device manufacturers can configure devices to ignore calls to this method to
  improve the layout of orientation-restricted apps.
* On devices with Android 16 (API level 36) or higher installed, virtual device
  owners (select trusted and privileged apps) can optimize app layout on displays
  they manage by ignoring calls to this method. See also
  [Companion app streaming](https://source.android.com/docs/core/permissions/app-streaming).

See [Device
compatibility mode](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/device-compatibility-mode).

```
public Object getSystemService (String name)
```

Return the handle to a system-level service by name. The class of the returned object varies
by the requested name. Currently available names are:

`WINDOW_SERVICE` ("window"): The top-level window manager in which you can place custom windows. The returned object is a `WindowManager`. Must only be obtained from a visual context such as Activity or a Context created with `createWindowContext(int,Bundle)`, which are adjusted to the configuration and visual bounds of an area on screen. `LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE` ("layout\_inflater"): A `LayoutInflater` for inflating layout resources in this context. Must only be obtained from a visual context such as Activity or a Context created with `createWindowContext(int,Bundle)`, which are adjusted to the configuration and visual bounds of an area on screen. `ACTIVITY_SERVICE` ("activity"): A `ActivityManager` for interacting with the global activity state of the system. `WALLPAPER_SERVICE` ("wallpaper"): A `WallpaperService` for accessing wallpapers in this context. Must only be obtained from a visual context such as Activity or a Context created with `createWindowContext(int,Bundle)`, which are adjusted to the configuration and visual bounds of an area on screen. `POWER_SERVICE` ("power"): A `PowerManager` for controlling power management. `ALARM_SERVICE` ("alarm"): A `AlarmManager` for receiving intents at the time of your choosing. `NOTIFICATION_SERVICE` ("notification"): A `NotificationManager` for informing the user of background events. `KEYGUARD_SERVICE` ("keyguard"): A `KeyguardManager` for controlling keyguard. `LOCATION_SERVICE` ("location"): A `LocationManager` for controlling location (e.g., GPS) updates. `SEARCH_SERVICE` ("search"): A `SearchManager` for handling search. `VIBRATOR_MANAGER_SERVICE` ("vibrator\_manager"): A `VibratorManager` for accessing the device vibrators, interacting with individual ones and playing synchronized effects on multiple vibrators. `MULTISENSORY_MANAGER_SERVICE` ("multisensory\_manager"): A `MultisensoryManager` for delivering audio-haptic feedback in the Multisensory Design System `VIBRATOR_SERVICE` ("vibrator"): A `Vibrator` for interacting with the vibrator hardware. `CONNECTIVITY_SERVICE` ("connectivity"): A `ConnectivityManager` for handling management of network connections. `IPSEC_SERVICE` ("ipsec"): A `IpSecManager` for managing IPSec on sockets and networks. `WIFI_SERVICE` ("wifi"): A `WifiManager` for management of Wi-Fi connectivity. On releases before Android 7, it should only be obtained from an application context, and not from any other derived context to avoid memory leaks within the calling process. `WIFI_AWARE_SERVICE` ("wifiaware"): A `WifiAwareManager` for management of Wi-Fi Aware discovery and connectivity. `WIFI_P2P_SERVICE` ("wifip2p"): A `WifiP2pManager` for management of Wi-Fi Direct connectivity. `INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE` ("input\_method"): An `InputMethodManager` for management of input methods. `UI_MODE_SERVICE` ("uimode"): An `UiModeManager` for controlling UI modes. `DOWNLOAD_SERVICE` ("download"): A `DownloadManager` for requesting HTTP downloads `BATTERY_SERVICE` ("batterymanager"): A `BatteryManager` for managing battery state `JOB_SCHEDULER_SERVICE` ("taskmanager"): A `JobScheduler` for managing scheduled tasks `NETWORK_STATS_SERVICE` ("netstats"): A `NetworkStatsManager` for querying network usage statistics. `HARDWARE_PROPERTIES_SERVICE` ("hardware\_properties"): A `HardwarePropertiesManager` for accessing hardware properties. `DOMAIN_VERIFICATION_SERVICE` ("domain\_verification"): A `DomainVerificationManager` for accessing web domain approval state. `DISPLAY_HASH_SERVICE` ("display\_hash"): A `DisplayHashManager` for management of display hashes. `AUTHENTICATION_POLICY_SERVICE` ("authentication\_policy"): A `AuthenticationPolicyManager` for managing authentication related policies on the device.

Note: System services obtained via this API may be closely associated with the Context in
which they are obtained from. In general, do not share the service objects between various
different contexts (Activities, Applications, Services, Providers, etc.)

Note: Instant apps, for which `PackageManager.isInstantApp()` returns true, don't
have access to the following system services: `DEVICE_POLICY_SERVICE`, `ERROR(/#FINGERPRINT_SERVICE)`, `KEYGUARD_SERVICE`, `SHORTCUT_SERVICE`, `USB_SERVICE`, `WALLPAPER_SERVICE`, `WIFI_P2P_SERVICE`, `WIFI_SERVICE`,
`WIFI_AWARE_SERVICE`. For these services this method will return `null`.
Generally, if you are running as an instant app you should always check whether the result of
this method is `null`.

Note: When implementing this method, keep in mind that new services can be added on newer
Android releases, so if you're looking for just the explicit names mentioned above, make sure
to return `null` when you don't recognize the name — if you throw a `RuntimeException` exception instead, your app might break on new Android releases.

### getWindow

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Window getWindow ()
```

Retrieve the current `Window` for the activity.
This can be used to directly access parts of the Window API that
are not available through Activity/Screen.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Window` | Window The current window, or null if the activity is not visual. |

### getWindowManager

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public WindowManager getWindowManager ()
```

Retrieve the window manager for showing custom windows.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `WindowManager` |  |

### hasWindowFocus

Added in [API level 3](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean hasWindowFocus ()
```

Returns true if this activity's *main* window currently has window focus.
Note that this is not the same as the view itself having focus.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | True if this activity's main window currently has window focus. |

**See also:**

* `onWindowAttributesChanged(android.view.WindowManager.LayoutParams)`

### invalidateOptionsMenu

Added in [API level 11](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void invalidateOptionsMenu ()
```

Declare that the options menu has changed, so should be recreated.
The `onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu)` method will be called the next
time it needs to be displayed.

### isActivityTransitionRunning

Added in [API level 26](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean isActivityTransitionRunning ()
```

Returns whether there are any activity transitions currently running on this
activity. A return value of `true` can mean that either an enter or
exit transition is running, including whether the background of the activity
is animating as a part of that transition.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | true if a transition is currently running on this activity, false otherwise. |

### isChangingConfigurations

Added in [API level 11](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean isChangingConfigurations ()
```

Check to see whether this activity is in the process of being destroyed in order to be
recreated with a new configuration.

This is often used in `onStop()` to determine whether the state needs to be cleaned
up or will be passed on to the next instance of the activity via
`onRetainNonConfigurationInstance()`. However, if the activity has already been in the
background as stopped, and then gets recreated with different configuration, there won't be
another `onPause()` or `onStop()` with this API returning `true`.

For example, if an activity that is not handling size configuration change is first
minimized, and then get rotated with the display, it should first receive `onPause()`
and `onStop()` with this API returning `false`, and then receive
`onDestroy()` with this API returning `true`.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | If the activity is being torn down in order to be recreated with a new configuration, returns true; else returns false. |

### isChild

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
35](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public final boolean isChild ()
```

**This method was deprecated
in API level 35.**  
`ActivityGroup` is deprecated.

Whether this is a child `Activity` of an `ActivityGroup`.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` |  |

### isDestroyed

Added in [API level 17](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean isDestroyed ()
```

Returns true if the final `onDestroy()` call has been made
on the Activity, so this instance is now dead.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` |  |

### isFinishing

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean isFinishing ()
```

Check to see whether this activity is in the process of finishing,
either because you called `finish()` on it or someone else
has requested that it finished.

This is often used in `onPause()` to determine whether the activity is simply pausing
or completely finishing. However, if the finish request is made after the activity has
already been paused/stopped, there won't be another `onPause()` or `onStop()` with
this API returning `true`.

For example, if an activity is first minimized, and then gets killed in background,
it should first receive `onPause()` and `onStop()` with this API returning
`false`, and then receive `onDestroy()` with this API returning `true`.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` |  |

**See also:**

* `finish()`

### isHandoffEnabled

Added in [API level 37](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public final boolean isHandoffEnabled ()
```

Returns if Handoff has been enabled for this Activity. See
`setHandoffEnabled(boolean, HandoffActivityParams)` to change if Handoff is enabled on this
Activity.
When Handoff is enabled, the user may request this Activity to be sent to
other devices that they owe. The system will request data from this
Activity to recreate it on the other device.
TODO (b/412338142): Add link to onHandoffActivityDataRequested once
method is added.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | Whether Handoff is enabled for the Activity |

### isImmersive

Added in [API level 18](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean isImmersive ()
```

Bit indicating that this activity is "immersive" and should not be
interrupted by notifications if possible.
This value is initially set by the manifest property
`android:immersive` but may be changed at runtime by
`setImmersive(boolean)`.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` |  |

**See also:**

* `setImmersive(boolean)`
* `ActivityInfo.FLAG_IMMERSIVE`

### isInMultiWindowMode

Added in [API level 24](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean isInMultiWindowMode ()
```

Returns true if the activity is currently in multi-window mode.

See [Support multi-window mode](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/layouts/adaptive/support-multi-window-mode) for recommendations on how to handle different multi-window
scenarios such as split-screen.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | True if the activity is in multi-window mode. |

**See also:**

* `R.attr.resizeableActivity`

### isInPictureInPictureMode

Added in [API level 24](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean isInPictureInPictureMode ()
```

Returns true if the activity is currently in picture-in-picture mode.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | True if the activity is in picture-in-picture mode. |

**See also:**

* `R.attr.supportsPictureInPicture`

### isLaunchedFromBubble

Added in [API level 31](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean isLaunchedFromBubble ()
```

Indicates whether this activity is launched from a bubble. A bubble is a floating shortcut
on the screen that expands to show an activity.
If your activity can be used normally or as a bubble, you might use this method to check
if the activity is bubbled to modify any behaviour that might be different between the
normal activity and the bubbled activity. For example, if you normally cancel the
notification associated with the activity when you open the activity, you might not want to
do that when you're bubbled as that would remove the bubble.
**Note:** This method will return `false` for app
Bubbles. See https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/layouts/adaptive/support-bubbles
and only applicable to chat bubbles.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | `true` if the activity is launched from a bubble. |

**See also:**

* `Notification.Builder.setBubbleMetadata(Notification.BubbleMetadata)`
* `Notification.BubbleMetadata.Builder.Builder(String)`

### isLocalVoiceInteractionSupported

Added in [API level 24](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean isLocalVoiceInteractionSupported ()
```

Queries whether the currently enabled voice interaction service supports returning
a voice interactor for use by the activity. This is valid only for the duration of the
activity.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | whether the current voice interaction service supports local voice interaction |

### isTaskRoot

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean isTaskRoot ()
```

Return whether this activity is the root of a task. The root is the
first activity in a task.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | True if this is the root activity, else false. |

### isVoiceInteraction

Added in [API level 23](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean isVoiceInteraction ()
```

Check whether this activity is running as part of a voice interaction with the user.
If true, it should perform its interaction with the user through the
`VoiceInteractor` returned by `getVoiceInteractor()`.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` |  |

### isVoiceInteractionRoot

Added in [API level 23](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean isVoiceInteractionRoot ()
```

Like `isVoiceInteraction()`, but only returns `true` if this is also the root
of a voice interaction. That is, returns `true` if this activity was directly
started by the voice interaction service as the initiation of a voice interaction.
Otherwise, for example if it was started by another activity while under voice
interaction, returns `false`.
If the activity `launchMode` is
`singleTask`, it forces the activity to launch in a new task, separate from the one
that started it. Therefore, there is no longer a relationship between them, and
`isVoiceInteractionRoot()` return `false` in this case.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` |  |

### managedQuery

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
15](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public final Cursor managedQuery (Uri uri, 
                String[] projection, 
                String selection, 
                String[] selectionArgs, 
                String sortOrder)
```

**This method was deprecated
in API level 15.**  
Use `CursorLoader` instead.

Wrapper around
`ContentResolver.query(android.net.Uri,String[],String,String[],String)`
that gives the resulting `Cursor` to call
`startManagingCursor(Cursor)` so that the activity will manage its
lifecycle for you.
*If you are targeting `Build.VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB`
or later, consider instead using `LoaderManager` instead, available
via `getLoaderManager()`.*

**Warning:** Do not call `Cursor.close()` on a cursor obtained using
this method, because the activity will do that for you at the appropriate time. However, if
you call `stopManagingCursor(Cursor)` on a cursor from a managed query, the system *will
not* automatically close the cursor and, in that case, you must call
`Cursor.close()`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `uri` | `Uri`: The URI of the content provider to query. |
| `projection` | `String`: List of columns to return. |
| `selection` | `String`: SQL WHERE clause. |
| `selectionArgs` | `String`: The arguments to selection, if any ?s are pesent |
| `sortOrder` | `String`: SQL ORDER BY clause. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Cursor` | The Cursor that was returned by query(). |

**See also:**

* `ContentResolver.query(android.net.Uri,String[],String,String[],String)`
* `startManagingCursor(Cursor)`

### moveTaskToBack

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean moveTaskToBack (boolean nonRoot)
```

Move the task containing this activity to the back of the activity
stack. The activity's order within the task is unchanged.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `nonRoot` | `boolean`: If false then this only works if the activity is the root of a task; if true it will work for any activity in a task. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | If the task was moved (or it was already at the back) true is returned, else false. |

### navigateUpTo

Added in [API level 16](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean navigateUpTo (Intent upIntent)
```

Navigate from this activity to the activity specified by upIntent, finishing this activity
in the process. If the activity indicated by upIntent already exists in the task's history,
this activity and all others before the indicated activity in the history stack will be
finished.

If the indicated activity does not appear in the history stack, this will finish
each activity in this task until the root activity of the task is reached, resulting in
an "in-app home" behavior. This can be useful in apps with a complex navigation hierarchy
when an activity may be reached by a path not passing through a canonical parent
activity.

This method should be used when performing up navigation from within the same task
as the destination. If up navigation should cross tasks in some cases, see
`shouldUpRecreateTask(Intent)`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `upIntent` | `Intent`: An intent representing the target destination for up navigation |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | true if up navigation successfully reached the activity indicated by upIntent and upIntent was delivered to it. false if an instance of the indicated activity could not be found and this activity was simply finished normally. |

### navigateUpToFromChild

Added in [API level 16](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
30](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean navigateUpToFromChild (Activity child, 
                Intent upIntent)
```

**This method was deprecated
in API level 30.**  
Use `navigateUpTo(Intent)` instead.

This is called when a child activity of this one calls its
`navigateUpTo(Intent)` method. The default implementation simply calls
navigateUpTo(upIntent) on this activity (the parent).

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `child` | `Activity`: The activity making the call. |
| `upIntent` | `Intent`: An intent representing the target destination for up navigation |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | true if up navigation successfully reached the activity indicated by upIntent and upIntent was delivered to it. false if an instance of the indicated activity could not be found and this activity was simply finished normally. |

### onActionModeFinished

Added in [API level 11](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onActionModeFinished (ActionMode mode)
```

Notifies the activity that an action mode has finished.
Activity subclasses overriding this method should call the superclass implementation.
  
If you override this method you *must* call through to the
superclass implementation.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `mode` | `ActionMode`: The action mode that just finished. |

### onActionModeStarted

Added in [API level 11](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onActionModeStarted (ActionMode mode)
```

Notifies the Activity that an action mode has been started.
Activity subclasses overriding this method should call the superclass implementation.
  
If you override this method you *must* call through to the
superclass implementation.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `mode` | `ActionMode`: The new action mode. |

### onActivityReenter

Added in [API level 21](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onActivityReenter (int resultCode, 
                Intent data)
```

Called when an activity you launched with an activity transition exposes this
Activity through a returning activity transition, giving you the resultCode
and any additional data from it. This method will only be called if the activity
set a result code other than `RESULT_CANCELED` and it supports activity
transitions with `Window.FEATURE_ACTIVITY_TRANSITIONS`.

The purpose of this function is to let the called Activity send a hint about
its state so that this underlying Activity can prepare to be exposed. A call to
this method does not guarantee that the called Activity has or will be exiting soon.
It only indicates that it will expose this Activity's Window and it has
some data to pass to prepare it.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `resultCode` | `int`: The integer result code returned by the child activity through its setResult(). |
| `data` | `Intent`: An Intent, which can return result data to the caller (various data can be attached to Intent "extras"). |

### onActivityResult

Added in [API level 35](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onActivityResult (int requestCode, 
                int resultCode, 
                Intent data, 
                ComponentCaller caller)
```

Same as `onActivityResult(int,int,Intent)`, but with an extra parameter for the
ComponentCaller instance associated with the app that sent the result.

If you want to retrieve the caller without overriding this method, call
`getCurrentCaller()` inside your existing `onActivityResult(int,int,Intent)`.

Note that you should only override one `onActivityResult(int, int, Intent)` method.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `requestCode` | `int`: The integer request code originally supplied to startActivityForResult(), allowing you to identify who this result came from. |

| `resultCode` | `int`: The integer result code returned by the child activity through its setResult(). |
| `data` | `Intent`: An Intent, which can return result data to the caller (various data can be attached to Intent "extras").   This value may be `null`. |
| `caller` | `ComponentCaller`: The `ComponentCaller` instance associated with the app that sent the intent.   This value cannot be `null`. |

### onAttachFragment

Added in [API level 11](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
28](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onAttachFragment (Fragment fragment)
```

**This method was deprecated
in API level 28.**  
Use `FragmentActivity.onAttachFragment(androidx.fragment.app.Fragment)`

Called when a Fragment is being attached to this activity, immediately
after the call to its `Fragment.onAttach()`
method and before `Fragment.onCreate()`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `fragment` | `Fragment` |

### onAttachedToWindow

Added in [API level 5](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onAttachedToWindow ()
```

Called when the main window associated with the activity has been
attached to the window manager.
See `View.onAttachedToWindow()`
for more information.

**See also:**

* `View.onAttachedToWindow`

### onBackPressed

Added in [API level 5](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
33](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onBackPressed ()
```

**This method was deprecated
in API level 33.**  
Use `OnBackInvokedCallback` or
`androidx.activity.OnBackPressedCallback` to handle back navigation instead.

Starting from Android 13 (API level 33), back event handling is
moving to an ahead-of-time model and `Activity.onBackPressed()` and
`KeyEvent.KEYCODE_BACK` should not be used to handle back events (back gesture or
back button click). Instead, an `OnBackInvokedCallback` should be registered using
`Activity.getOnBackInvokedDispatcher()`
`.registerOnBackInvokedCallback(priority, callback)`.

Called when the activity has detected the user's press of the back key. The default
implementation depends on the platform version:

* On platform versions prior to `Build.VERSION_CODES.S`, it
  finishes the current activity, but you can override this to do whatever you want.* Starting with platform version `Build.VERSION_CODES.S`, for
    activities that are the root activity of the task and also declare an
    `IntentFilter` with `Intent.ACTION_MAIN` and
    `Intent.CATEGORY_LAUNCHER` in the manifest, the current activity and its
    task will be moved to the back of the activity stack instead of being finished.
    Other activities will simply be finished.* If you target version `Build.VERSION_CODES.S` and
      override this method, we strongly recommend to call through to the superclass
      implementation after you finish handling navigation within the app.* If you target version `Build.VERSION_CODES.TIRAMISU` or later,
        you should not use this method but register an `OnBackInvokedCallback` on an
        `OnBackInvokedDispatcher` that you can retrieve using
        `getOnBackInvokedDispatcher()`. You should also set
        `android:enableOnBackInvokedCallback="true"` in the application manifest.

        Alternatively, you can use
        `androidx.activity.ComponentActivity#getOnBackPressedDispatcher()`
        for backward compatibility.

**See also:**

* `moveTaskToBack(boolean)`

### onConfigurationChanged

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onConfigurationChanged (Configuration newConfig)
```

Called by the system when the device configuration changes while your
activity is running. Note that this will only be called if you have
selected configurations you would like to handle with the
`R.attr.configChanges` attribute in your manifest. If
any configuration change occurs that is not selected to be reported
by that attribute, then instead of reporting it the system will stop
and restart the activity (to have it launched with the new
configuration). The only exception is if a size-based configuration
is not large enough to be considered significant, in which case the
system will not recreate the activity and will instead call this
method. For details on this see the documentation on
[size-based config change](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/runtime-changes).

At the time that this function has been called, your Resources
object will have been updated to return resource values matching the
new configuration.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `newConfig` | `Configuration`: The new device configuration.   This value cannot be `null`. |

### onContentChanged

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onContentChanged ()
```

This hook is called whenever the content view of the screen changes
(due to a call to
`Window.setContentView` or
`Window.addContentView`).

### onContextItemSelected

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean onContextItemSelected (MenuItem item)
```

This hook is called whenever an item in a context menu is selected. The
default implementation simply returns false to have the normal processing
happen (calling the item's Runnable or sending a message to its Handler
as appropriate). You can use this method for any items for which you
would like to do processing without those other facilities.

Use `MenuItem.getMenuInfo()` to get extra information set by the
View that added this menu item.

Derived classes should call through to the base class for it to perform
the default menu handling.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `item` | `MenuItem`: The context menu item that was selected.   This value cannot be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | boolean Return false to allow normal context menu processing to proceed, true to consume it here. |

### onContextMenuClosed

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onContextMenuClosed (Menu menu)
```

This hook is called whenever the context menu is being closed (either by
the user canceling the menu with the back/menu button, or when an item is
selected).

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `menu` | `Menu`: The context menu that is being closed.   This value cannot be `null`. |

### onCreate

Added in [API level 21](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onCreate (Bundle savedInstanceState, 
                PersistableBundle persistentState)
```

Same as `onCreate(android.os.Bundle)` but called for those activities created with
the attribute `R.attr.persistableMode` set to
`persistAcrossReboots`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `savedInstanceState` | `Bundle`: if the activity is being re-initialized after previously being shut down then this Bundle contains the data it most recently supplied in `onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)`. ***Note: Otherwise it is null.*** |
| `persistentState` | `PersistableBundle`: if the activity is being re-initialized after previously being shut down, powered off or updated to a new version then this Bundle contains the data it most recently supplied to outPersistentState in `onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)`. ***Note: Otherwise it is null.*** |

**See also:**

* `onCreate(android.os.Bundle)`
* `onStart()`
* `onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)`
* `onRestoreInstanceState(Bundle)`
* `onPostCreate(Bundle)`

### onCreateContextMenu

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onCreateContextMenu (ContextMenu menu, 
                View v, 
                ContextMenu.ContextMenuInfo menuInfo)
```

Called when a context menu for the `view` is about to be shown.
Unlike `onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu)`, this will be called every
time the context menu is about to be shown and should be populated for
the view (or item inside the view for `AdapterView` subclasses,
this can be found in the `menuInfo`)).

Use `onContextItemSelected(android.view.MenuItem)` to know when an
item has been selected.

It is not safe to hold onto the context menu after this method returns.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `menu` | `ContextMenu`: The context menu that is being built |

| `v` | `View`: The view for which the context menu is being built |
| `menuInfo` | `ContextMenu.ContextMenuInfo`: Extra information about the item for which the context menu should be shown. This information will vary depending on the class of v. |

### onCreateDescription

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public CharSequence onCreateDescription ()
```

Generate a new description for this activity. This method is called
before stopping the activity and can, if desired, return some textual
description of its current state to be displayed to the user.

The default implementation returns null, which will cause you to
inherit the description from the previous activity. If all activities
return null, generally the label of the top activity will be used as the
description.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `CharSequence` | A description of what the user is doing. It should be short and sweet (only a few words). |

**See also:**

* `onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)`
* `onStop()`

### onCreateNavigateUpTaskStack

Added in [API level 16](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onCreateNavigateUpTaskStack (TaskStackBuilder builder)
```

Define the synthetic task stack that will be generated during Up navigation from
a different task.

The default implementation of this method adds the parent chain of this activity
as specified in the manifest to the supplied `TaskStackBuilder`. Applications
may choose to override this method to construct the desired task stack in a different
way.

This method will be invoked by the default implementation of `onNavigateUp()`
if `shouldUpRecreateTask(Intent)` returns true when supplied with the intent
returned by `getParentActivityIntent()`.

Applications that wish to supply extra Intent parameters to the parent stack defined
by the manifest should override `onPrepareNavigateUpTaskStack(TaskStackBuilder)`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `builder` | `TaskStackBuilder`: An empty TaskStackBuilder - the application should add intents representing the desired task stack |

### onCreateOptionsMenu

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu (Menu menu)
```

Initialize the contents of the Activity's standard options menu. You
should place your menu items in to menu.

This is only called once, the first time the options menu is
displayed. To update the menu every time it is displayed, see
`onPrepareOptionsMenu(Menu)`.

The default implementation populates the menu with standard system
menu items. These are placed in the `Menu.CATEGORY_SYSTEM` group so that
they will be correctly ordered with application-defined menu items.
Deriving classes should always call through to the base implementation.

You can safely hold on to menu (and any items created
from it), making modifications to it as desired, until the next
time onCreateOptionsMenu() is called.

When you add items to the menu, you can implement the Activity's
`onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem)` method to handle them there.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `menu` | `Menu`: The options menu in which you place your items. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | You must return true for the menu to be displayed; if you return false it will not be shown. |

**See also:**

* `onPrepareOptionsMenu(Menu)`
* `onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem)`

### onCreatePanelMenu

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean onCreatePanelMenu (int featureId, 
                Menu menu)
```

Default implementation of
`Window.Callback.onCreatePanelMenu(int, Menu)`
for activities. This calls through to the new
`onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu)` method for the
`Window.FEATURE_OPTIONS_PANEL` panel,
so that subclasses of Activity don't need to deal with feature codes.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `featureId` | `int`: The panel being created. |
| `menu` | `Menu`: This value cannot be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | boolean You must return true for the panel to be displayed; if you return false it will not be shown. |

### onCreatePanelView

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public View onCreatePanelView (int featureId)
```

Default implementation of
`Window.Callback.onCreatePanelView(int)`
for activities. This
simply returns null so that all panel sub-windows will have the default
menu behavior.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `featureId` | `int`: Which panel is being created. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `View` | view The top-level view to place in the panel. |

Deprecated in
[API level
28](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean onCreateThumbnail (Bitmap outBitmap, 
                Canvas canvas)
```

**This method was deprecated
in API level 28.**  
Method doesn't do anything and will be removed in the future.

| Parameters | |

| `outBitmap` | `Bitmap` |
| `canvas` | `Canvas` |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` |  |

### onCreateView

Added in [API level 11](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public View onCreateView (View parent, 
                String name, 
                Context context, 
                AttributeSet attrs)
```

Standard implementation of
`android.view.LayoutInflater.Factory2.onCreateView(View,String,Context,AttributeSet)`
used when inflating with the LayoutInflater returned by `Context.getSystemService(Class)`.
This implementation handles  tags to embed fragments inside
of the activity.

### onCreateView

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public View onCreateView (String name, 
                Context context, 
                AttributeSet attrs)
```

Standard implementation of
`LayoutInflater.Factory.onCreateView(String, Context, AttributeSet)` used when
inflating with the LayoutInflater returned by `Context.getSystemService(Class)`.
This implementation does nothing and is for
pre-`Build.VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB` apps. Newer apps
should use `onCreateView(View,String,Context,AttributeSet)`.

* `Window.getLayoutInflater()`

### onDetachedFromWindow

Added in [API level 5](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onDetachedFromWindow ()
```

Called when the main window associated with the activity has been
detached from the window manager.
See `View.onDetachedFromWindow()`
for more information.

**See also:**

* `View.onDetachedFromWindow`

### onEnterAnimationComplete

Added in [API level 21](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onEnterAnimationComplete ()
```

Activities cannot draw during the period that their windows are animating in. In order
to know when it is safe to begin drawing they can override this method which will be
called when the entering animation has completed.

### onGenericMotionEvent

Added in [API level 12](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean onGenericMotionEvent (MotionEvent event)
```

Called when a generic motion event was not handled by any of the
views inside of the activity.

Generic motion events describe joystick movements, hover events from mouse or stylus
devices, trackpad touches, scroll wheel movements and other motion events not handled
by `onTouchEvent(MotionEvent)` or `onTrackballEvent(MotionEvent)`.
The `source` of the motion event specifies
the class of input that was received. Implementations of this method
must examine the bits in the source before processing the event.

Generic motion events with source class
`InputDevice.SOURCE_CLASS_POINTER`
are delivered to the view under the pointer. All other generic motion events are
delivered to the focused view.

See `View.onGenericMotionEvent(MotionEvent)` for an example of how to
handle this event.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `event` | `MotionEvent`: The generic motion event being processed. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | Return true if you have consumed the event, false if you haven't. The default implementation always returns false. |

### onGetDirectActions

Added in [API level 29](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onGetDirectActions (CancellationSignal cancellationSignal, 
                Consumer<List<DirectAction>> callback)
```

Returns the list of direct actions supported by the app.

You should return the list of actions that could be executed in the
current context, which is in the current state of the app. If the actions
that could be executed by the app changes you should report that via
calling `VoiceInteractor.notifyDirectActionsChanged()`.

To get the voice interactor you need to call `getVoiceInteractor()`
which would return non `null` only if there is an ongoing voice
interaction session. You can also detect when the voice interactor is no
longer valid because the voice interaction session that is backing is finished
by calling `VoiceInteractor.registerOnDestroyedCallback(Executor,Runnable)`.

This method will be called only after `onStart()` and before `onStop()`.

You should pass to the callback the currently supported direct actions which
cannot be `null` or contain `null` elements.

You should return the action list as soon as possible to ensure the consumer,
for example the assistant, is as responsive as possible which would improve user
experience of your app.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `cancellationSignal` | `CancellationSignal`: A signal to cancel the operation in progress.   This value cannot be `null`. |

| `callback` | `Consumer`: The callback to send the action list. The actions list cannot contain `null` elements. You can call this on any thread. |

### onHandoffActivityDataRequested

Added in [API level 37](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public HandoffActivityData onHandoffActivityDataRequested (HandoffActivityDataRequestInfo requestInfo)
```

Retrieves `HandoffActivityData` representing this activity, allowing it to be recreated
on another device owned by the user.
The system automatically handles calling #onHandoffActivityDataRequested. This will only be
called if `isHandoffEnabled()` is `true` for this activity.
If `isHandoffEnabled()` is `true`, the activity is expected to return a non-null
value. Returning `null` will present an error to the user indicating Handoff
unexpectedly failed.
If the current activity is in the foreground on the current device, the app's icon
representing this activity will be shown on other nearby devices owned
by the user. If the user selects this icon, the system will call this method
to retrieve the data needed to recreate this activity on another device.
When this activity is stopped, the system will call this method
to retrieve `HandoffActivityData` for caching. This allows the user
to hand this activity off to another device even if it is not currently
running. In these situations, `HandoffActivityDataRequestInfo.isActiveRequest`
will be `false`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `requestInfo` | `HandoffActivityDataRequestInfo`: the request info for the activity data.   This value cannot be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `HandoffActivityData` | the activity data for handoff. |

### onKeyDown

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean onKeyDown (int keyCode, 
                KeyEvent event)
```

Called when a key was pressed down and not handled by any of the views
inside of the activity. So, for example, key presses while the cursor
is inside a TextView will not trigger the event (unless it is a navigation
to another object) because TextView handles its own key presses.

If the focused view didn't want this event, this method is called.

The default implementation takes care of `KeyEvent.KEYCODE_BACK`
by calling `onBackPressed()`, though the behavior varies based
on the application compatibility mode: for
`Build.VERSION_CODES.ECLAIR` or later applications,
it will set up the dispatch to call `onKeyUp(int, KeyEvent)` where the action
will be performed; for earlier applications, it will perform the
action immediately in on-down, as those versions of the platform
behaved. This implementation will also take care of `KeyEvent.KEYCODE_ESCAPE`
by finishing the activity if it would be closed by touching outside
of it.

Other additional default key handling may be performed
if configured with `setDefaultKeyMode(int)`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `keyCode` | `int`: The value in event.getKeyCode(). |

| `event` | `KeyEvent`: Description of the key event. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | Return `true` to prevent this event from being propagated further, or `false` to indicate that you have not handled this event and it should continue to be propagated. |

**See also:**

* `onKeyUp(int, KeyEvent)`
* `KeyEvent`

### onKeyLongPress

Added in [API level 5](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean onKeyLongPress (int keyCode, 
                KeyEvent event)
```

Default implementation of `KeyEvent.Callback.onKeyLongPress()`: always returns false (doesn't handle
the event).
To receive this callback, you must return true from onKeyDown for the current
event stream.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `keyCode` | `int`: The value in event.getKeyCode(). |
| `event` | `KeyEvent`: Description of the key event. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | If you handled the event, return true. If you want to allow the event to be handled by the next receiver, return false. |

**See also:**

* `KeyEvent.Callback.onKeyLongPress(int,KeyEvent)`

### onKeyMultiple

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean onKeyMultiple (int keyCode, 
                int repeatCount, 
                KeyEvent event)
```

Default implementation of `KeyEvent.Callback.onKeyMultiple()`: always returns false (doesn't handle
the event).

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `keyCode` | `int`: The value in event.getKeyCode(). |
| `repeatCount` | `int`: Number of pairs as returned by event.getRepeatCount(). |
| `event` | `KeyEvent`: Description of the key event. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | If you handled the event, return true. If you want to allow the event to be handled by the next receiver, return false. |

### onKeyShortcut

Added in [API level 11](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean onKeyShortcut (int keyCode, 
                KeyEvent event)
```

Called when a key shortcut event is not handled by any of the views in the Activity.
Override this method to implement global key shortcuts for the Activity.
Key shortcuts can also be implemented by setting the
`shortcut` property of menu items.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `keyCode` | `int`: The value in event.getKeyCode(). |
| `event` | `KeyEvent`: Description of the key event. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | True if the key shortcut was handled. |

### onKeyUp

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean onKeyUp (int keyCode, 
                KeyEvent event)
```

Called when a key was released and not handled by any of the views
inside of the activity. So, for example, key presses while the cursor
is inside a TextView will not trigger the event (unless it is a navigation
to another object) because TextView handles its own key presses.

The default implementation handles KEYCODE\_BACK to stop the activity
and go back.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `keyCode` | `int`: The value in event.getKeyCode(). |
| `event` | `KeyEvent`: Description of the key event. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | Return `true` to prevent this event from being propagated further, or `false` to indicate that you have not handled this event and it should continue to be propagated. |

**See also:**

* `onKeyDown(int, KeyEvent)`
* `KeyEvent`

### onLocalVoiceInteractionStarted

Added in [API level 24](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onLocalVoiceInteractionStarted ()
```

Callback to indicate that `startLocalVoiceInteraction(Bundle)` has resulted in a
voice interaction session being started. You can now retrieve a voice interactor using
`getVoiceInteractor()`.

### onLocalVoiceInteractionStopped

Added in [API level 24](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onLocalVoiceInteractionStopped ()
```

Callback to indicate that the local voice interaction has stopped either
because it was requested through a call to `stopLocalVoiceInteraction()`
or because it was canceled by the user. The previously acquired `VoiceInteractor`
is no longer valid after this.

### onLowMemory

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onLowMemory ()
```

This is called when the overall system is running low on memory, and
actively running processes should trim their memory usage. While
the exact point at which this will be called is not defined, generally
it will happen when all background process have been killed.
That is, before reaching the point of killing processes hosting
service and foreground UI that we would like to avoid killing.

### onMenuItemSelected

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean onMenuItemSelected (int featureId, 
                MenuItem item)
```

Default implementation of
`Window.Callback.onMenuItemSelected(int, MenuItem)`
for activities. This calls through to the new
`onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem)` method for the
`Window.FEATURE_OPTIONS_PANEL`
panel, so that subclasses of
Activity don't need to deal with feature codes.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `featureId` | `int`: The panel that the menu is in. |
| `item` | `MenuItem`: This value cannot be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | boolean Return true to finish processing of selection, or false to perform the normal menu handling (calling its Runnable or sending a Message to its target Handler). |

### onMenuOpened

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean onMenuOpened (int featureId, 
                Menu menu)
```

Called when a panel's menu is opened by the user. This may also be
called when the menu is changing from one type to another (for
example, from the icon menu to the expanded menu).

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `featureId` | `int`: The panel that the menu is in. |
| `menu` | `Menu`: This value cannot be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |

### onMultiWindowModeChanged

Added in [API level 24](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
26](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onMultiWindowModeChanged (boolean isInMultiWindowMode)
```

**This method was deprecated
in API level 26.**  
Use `onMultiWindowModeChanged(boolean,Configuration)` instead.

Called by the system when the activity changes from fullscreen mode to multi-window mode and
visa-versa.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `isInMultiWindowMode` | `boolean`: True if the activity is in multi-window mode. |

**See also:**

* `R.attr.resizeableActivity`

### onMultiWindowModeChanged

Added in [API level 26](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onMultiWindowModeChanged (boolean isInMultiWindowMode, 
                Configuration newConfig)
```

Called by the system when the activity changes from fullscreen mode to multi-window mode and
visa-versa. This method provides the same configuration that will be sent in the following
`onConfigurationChanged(Configuration)` call after the activity enters this mode.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `isInMultiWindowMode` | `boolean`: True if the activity is in multi-window mode. |
| `newConfig` | `Configuration`: The new configuration of the activity with the state `isInMultiWindowMode`. |

**See also:**

### onNavigateUp

Added in [API level 16](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean onNavigateUp ()
```

This method is called whenever the user chooses to navigate Up within your application's
activity hierarchy from the action bar.

If the attribute `parentActivityName`
was specified in the manifest for this activity or an activity-alias to it,
default Up navigation will be handled automatically. If any activity
along the parent chain requires extra Intent arguments, the Activity subclass
should override the method `onPrepareNavigateUpTaskStack(TaskStackBuilder)`
to supply those arguments.

See [Tasks and Back Stack](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/tasks-and-back-stack)
from the developer guide and [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/design/patterns/navigation)
from the design guide for more information about navigating within your app.

See the `TaskStackBuilder` class and the Activity methods
`getParentActivityIntent()`, `shouldUpRecreateTask(Intent)`, and
`navigateUpTo(Intent)` for help implementing custom Up navigation.
The AppNavigation sample application in the Android SDK is also available for reference.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | true if Up navigation completed successfully and this Activity was finished, false otherwise. |

### onNavigateUpFromChild

Added in [API level 16](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
30](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean onNavigateUpFromChild (Activity child)
```

**This method was deprecated
in API level 30.**  
Use `onNavigateUp()` instead.

This is called when a child activity of this one attempts to navigate up.
The default implementation simply calls onNavigateUp() on this activity (the parent).

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `child` | `Activity`: The activity making the call. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` |  |

### onNewIntent

Added in [API level 35](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onNewIntent (Intent intent, 
                ComponentCaller caller)
```

Same as `onNewIntent(Intent)`, but with an extra parameter for the ComponentCaller
instance associated with the app that sent the intent.

If you want to retrieve the caller without overriding this method, call
`getCurrentCaller()` inside your existing `onNewIntent(Intent)`.

Note that you should only override one `onNewIntent(Intent)` method.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `intent` | `Intent`: The new intent that was used to start the activity.   This value cannot be `null`. |

| `caller` | `ComponentCaller`: The `ComponentCaller` instance associated with the app that sent the intent.   This value cannot be `null`. |

**See also:**

* `ComponentCaller`
* `onNewIntent(Intent)`
* `getCurrentCaller()`
* `setIntent(Intent,ComponentCaller)`
* `getCaller()`

### onOptionsItemSelected

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean onOptionsItemSelected (MenuItem item)
```

This hook is called whenever an item in your options menu is selected.
The default implementation simply returns false to have the normal
processing happen (calling the item's Runnable or sending a message to
its Handler as appropriate). You can use this method for any items
for which you would like to do processing without those other
facilities.

Derived classes should call through to the base class for it to
perform the default menu handling.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `item` | `MenuItem`: The menu item that was selected.   This value cannot be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | boolean Return false to allow normal menu processing to proceed, true to consume it here. |

**See also:**

* `onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu)`

### onOptionsMenuClosed

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onOptionsMenuClosed (Menu menu)
```

This hook is called whenever the options menu is being closed (either by the user canceling
the menu with the back/menu button, or when an item is selected).

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `menu` | `Menu`: The options menu as last shown or first initialized by onCreateOptionsMenu(). |

### onPanelClosed

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onPanelClosed (int featureId, 
                Menu menu)
```

Default implementation of
`android.view.Window.Callback.onPanelClosed(int,Menu)` for
activities. This calls through to `onOptionsMenuClosed(Menu)`
method for the `Window.FEATURE_OPTIONS_PANEL` panel,
so that subclasses of Activity don't need to deal with feature codes.
For context menus (`Window.FEATURE_CONTEXT_MENU`), the
`onContextMenuClosed(Menu)` will be called.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `featureId` | `int`: The panel that is being displayed. |
| `menu` | `Menu`: This value cannot be `null`. |

### onPerformDirectAction

Added in [API level 29](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onPerformDirectAction (String actionId, 
                Bundle arguments, 
                CancellationSignal cancellationSignal, 
                Consumer<Bundle> resultListener)
```

This is called to perform an action previously defined by the app.
Apps also have access to `getVoiceInteractor()` to follow up on the action.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `actionId` | `String`: The ID for the action you previously reported via `onGetDirectActions(CancellationSignal,Consumer)`.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `arguments` | `Bundle`: Any additional arguments provided by the caller that are specific to the given action.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `cancellationSignal` | `CancellationSignal`: A signal to cancel the operation in progress.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `resultListener` | `Consumer`: The callback to provide the result back to the caller. You can call this on any thread. The result bundle is action specific.   This value cannot be `null`. |

**See also:**

* `onGetDirectActions(CancellationSignal,Consumer)`

### onPictureInPictureModeChanged

Added in [API level 26](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onPictureInPictureModeChanged (boolean isInPictureInPictureMode, 
                Configuration newConfig)
```

Called by the system when the activity changes to and from picture-in-picture mode. This
method provides the same configuration that will be sent in the following
`onConfigurationChanged(Configuration)` call after the activity enters this mode.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `isInPictureInPictureMode` | `boolean`: True if the activity is in picture-in-picture mode. |
| `newConfig` | `Configuration`: The new configuration of the activity with the state `isInPictureInPictureMode`. |

**See also:**

* `R.attr.supportsPictureInPicture`

### onPictureInPictureModeChanged

Added in [API level 24](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
26](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onPictureInPictureModeChanged (boolean isInPictureInPictureMode)
```

**This method was deprecated
in API level 26.**  
Use `onPictureInPictureModeChanged(boolean,Configuration)` instead.

Called by the system when the activity changes to and from picture-in-picture mode.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `isInPictureInPictureMode` | `boolean`: True if the activity is in picture-in-picture mode. |

**See also:**

* `R.attr.supportsPictureInPicture`

### onPictureInPictureRequested

Added in [API level 30](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean onPictureInPictureRequested ()
```

This method is called by the system in various cases where picture in picture mode should be
entered if supported.

It is up to the app developer to choose whether to call
`enterPictureInPictureMode(PictureInPictureParams)` at this time. For example, the
system will call this method when the activity is being put into the background, so the app
developer might want to switch an activity into PIP mode instead.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | `true` if the activity received this callback regardless of if it acts on it or not. If `false`, the framework will assume the app hasn't been updated to leverage this callback and will in turn send a legacy callback of `onUserLeaveHint()` for the app to enter picture-in-picture mode. |

### onPictureInPictureUiStateChanged

Added in [API level 31](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onPictureInPictureUiStateChanged (PictureInPictureUiState pipState)
```

Called by the system when the activity is in PiP and has state changes.
Compare to `onPictureInPictureModeChanged(boolean,Configuration)`, which is only
called when PiP mode changes (meaning, enters or exits PiP), this can be called at any time
while the activity is in PiP mode. Therefore, all invocation can only happen after
`onPictureInPictureModeChanged(boolean,Configuration)` is called with true, and
before `onPictureInPictureModeChanged(boolean,Configuration)` is called with false.
You would not need to worry about cases where this is called and the activity is not in
Picture-In-Picture mode. For managing cases where the activity enters/exits
Picture-in-Picture (e.g. resources clean-up on exit), use
`onPictureInPictureModeChanged(boolean,Configuration)`.
The default state is everything declared in `PictureInPictureUiState` is false, such as
`PictureInPictureUiState.isStashed()`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `pipState` | `PictureInPictureUiState`: the new Picture-in-Picture state.   This value cannot be `null`. |

### onPostCreate

Added in [API level 21](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onPostCreate (Bundle savedInstanceState, 
                PersistableBundle persistentState)
```

This is the same as `onPostCreate(Bundle)` but is called for activities
created with the attribute `R.attr.persistableMode` set to
`persistAcrossReboots`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `savedInstanceState` | `Bundle`: The data most recently supplied in `onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)`   This value may be `null`. |
| `persistentState` | `PersistableBundle`: The data coming from the PersistableBundle first saved in `onSaveInstanceState(Bundle,PersistableBundle)`.   This value may be `null`. |

**See also:**

* `onCreate(Bundle)`

### onPrepareNavigateUpTaskStack

Added in [API level 16](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onPrepareNavigateUpTaskStack (TaskStackBuilder builder)
```

Prepare the synthetic task stack that will be generated during Up navigation
from a different task.

This method receives the `TaskStackBuilder` with the constructed series of
Intents as generated by `onCreateNavigateUpTaskStack(TaskStackBuilder)`.
If any extra data should be added to these intents before launching the new task,
the application should override this method and add that data here.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `builder` | `TaskStackBuilder`: A TaskStackBuilder that has been populated with Intents by onCreateNavigateUpTaskStack. |

### onPrepareOptionsMenu

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean onPrepareOptionsMenu (Menu menu)
```

Prepare the Screen's standard options menu to be displayed. This is
called right before the menu is shown, every time it is shown. You can
use this method to efficiently enable/disable items or otherwise
dynamically modify the contents.

The default implementation updates the system menu items based on the
activity's state. Deriving classes should always call through to the
base class implementation.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `menu` | `Menu`: The options menu as last shown or first initialized by onCreateOptionsMenu(). |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | You must return true for the menu to be displayed; if you return false it will not be shown. |

**See also:**

* `onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu)`

### onPreparePanel

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean onPreparePanel (int featureId, 
                View view, 
                Menu menu)
```

Default implementation of
`Window.Callback.onPreparePanel(int, View, Menu)`
for activities. This
calls through to the new `onPrepareOptionsMenu(Menu)` method for the
`Window.FEATURE_OPTIONS_PANEL`
panel, so that subclasses of
Activity don't need to deal with feature codes.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `featureId` | `int`: The panel that is being displayed. |
| `view` | `View`: This value may be `null`. |
| `menu` | `Menu`: This value cannot be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | boolean You must return true for the panel to be displayed; if you return false it will not be shown. |

### onProvideAssistContent

Added in [API level 23](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onProvideAssistContent (AssistContent outContent)
```

This is called when the user is requesting an assist, to provide references
to content related to the current activity. Before being called, the
`outContent` Intent is filled with the base Intent of the activity (the Intent
returned by `getIntent()`). The Intent's extras are stripped of any types
that are not valid for `PersistableBundle` or non-framework Parcelables, and
the flags `Intent.FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION` and
`Intent.FLAG_GRANT_PERSISTABLE_URI_PERMISSION` are cleared from the Intent.

Custom implementation may adjust the content intent to better reflect the top-level
context of the activity, and fill in its ClipData with additional content of
interest that the user is currently viewing. For example, an image gallery application
that has launched in to an activity allowing the user to swipe through pictures should
modify the intent to reference the current image they are looking it; such an
application when showing a list of pictures should add a ClipData that has
references to all of the pictures currently visible on screen.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `outContent` | `AssistContent`: The assist content to return. |

### onProvideAssistData

Added in [API level 18](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onProvideAssistData (Bundle data)
```

This is called when the user is requesting an assist, to build a full
`Intent.ACTION_ASSIST` Intent with all of the context of the current
application. You can override this method to place into the bundle anything
you would like to appear in the `Intent.EXTRA_ASSIST_CONTEXT` part
of the assist Intent.

This function will be called after any global assist callbacks that had
been registered with `Application.registerOnProvideAssistDataListener`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `data` | `Bundle` |

### onProvideKeyboardShortcuts

Added in [API level 24](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onProvideKeyboardShortcuts (List<KeyboardShortcutGroup> data, 
                Menu menu, 
                int deviceId)
```

Called when Keyboard Shortcuts are requested for the current window.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `data` | `List`: The data list to populate with shortcuts. |
| `menu` | `Menu`: The current menu, which may be null. |
| `deviceId` | `int`: The id for the connected device the shortcuts should be provided for. |

### onProvideReferrer

Added in [API level 23](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Uri onProvideReferrer ()
```

Override to generate the desired referrer for the content currently being shown
by the app. The default implementation returns null, meaning the referrer will simply
be the android-app: of the package name of this activity. Return a non-null Uri to
have that supplied as the `Intent.EXTRA_REFERRER` of any activities started from it.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Uri` |  |

### onRequestPermissionsResult

Added in [API level 23](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onRequestPermissionsResult (int requestCode, 
                String[] permissions, 
                int[] grantResults)
```

Callback for the result from requesting permissions. This method
is invoked for every call on `requestPermissions(String, int)`

**Note:** It is possible that the permissions request interaction
with the user is interrupted. In this case you will receive empty permissions
and results arrays which should be treated as a cancellation.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `requestCode` | `int`: The request code passed in `requestPermissions(String, int)`. |
| `permissions` | `String`: The requested permissions. Never null. |
| `grantResults` | `int`: The grant results for the corresponding permissions which is either `PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED` or `PackageManager.PERMISSION_DENIED`. Never null. |

**See also:**

* `requestPermissions(String, int)`

### onRequestPermissionsResult

Added in [API level 35](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onRequestPermissionsResult (int requestCode, 
                String[] permissions, 
                int[] grantResults, 
                int deviceId)
```

Callback for the result from requesting permissions. This method
is invoked for every call on `requestPermissions(String, int)`.

**Note:** It is possible that the permissions request interaction
with the user is interrupted. In this case you will receive empty permissions
and results arrays which should be treated as a cancellation.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `requestCode` | `int`: The request code passed in `requestPermissions(String, int)`. |
| `permissions` | `String`: The requested permissions. Never null. |
| `grantResults` | `int`: The grant results for the corresponding permissions which is either `PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED` or `PackageManager.PERMISSION_DENIED`. Never null. |
| `deviceId` | `int`: The deviceId for which permissions were requested. The primary/physical device is assigned `Context.DEVICE_ID_DEFAULT`, and virtual devices are assigned unique device Ids. |

**See also:**

* `requestPermissions(String, int)`

### onRestoreInstanceState

Added in [API level 21](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onRestoreInstanceState (Bundle savedInstanceState, 
                PersistableBundle persistentState)
```

This is the same as `onRestoreInstanceState(Bundle)` but is called for activities
created with the attribute `R.attr.persistableMode` set to
`persistAcrossReboots`. The `PersistableBundle` passed
came from the restored PersistableBundle first
saved in `onSaveInstanceState(Bundle,PersistableBundle)`.

This method is called between `onStart()` and
`onPostCreate(Bundle)`.

If this method is called `onRestoreInstanceState(Bundle)` will not be called.

At least one of `savedInstanceState` or `persistentState` will not be null.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `savedInstanceState` | `Bundle`: the data most recently supplied in `onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)` or null. |

| `persistentState` | `PersistableBundle`: the data most recently supplied in `onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)` or null. |

**See also:**

* `onRestoreInstanceState(Bundle)`
* `onCreate(Bundle)`
* `onPostCreate(Bundle)`
* `onResume()`
* `onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)`

### onRetainNonConfigurationInstance

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Object onRetainNonConfigurationInstance ()
```

Called by the system, as part of destroying an
activity due to a configuration change, when it is known that a new
instance will immediately be created for the new configuration. You
can return any object you like here, including the activity instance
itself, which can later be retrieved by calling
`getLastNonConfigurationInstance()` in the new activity
instance.
*If you are targeting `Build.VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB`
or later, consider instead using a `Fragment` with
`Fragment.setRetainInstance(boolean`.*

This function is called purely as an optimization, and you must
not rely on it being called. When it is called, a number of guarantees
will be made to help optimize configuration switching:

* The function will be called between `onStop()` and
  `onDestroy()`.* A new instance of the activity will *always* be immediately
    created after this one's `onDestroy()` is called. In particular,
    *no* messages will be dispatched during this time (when the returned
    object does not have an activity to be associated with).* The object you return here will *always* be available from
      the `getLastNonConfigurationInstance()` method of the following
      activity instance as described there.

These guarantees are designed so that an activity can use this API
to propagate extensive state from the old to new activity instance, from
loaded bitmaps, to network connections, to evenly actively running
threads. Note that you should *not* propagate any data that
may change based on the configuration, including any data loaded from
resources such as strings, layouts, or drawables.

The guarantee of no message handling during the switch to the next
activity simplifies use with active objects. For example if your retained
state is an `AsyncTask` you are guaranteed that its
call back functions (like `AsyncTask.onPostExecute(Result)`) will
not be called from the call here until you execute the next instance's
`onCreate(Bundle)`. (Note however that there is of course no such
guarantee for `AsyncTask.doInBackground(Params)` since that is
running in a separate thread.)

**Note:** For most cases you should use the `Fragment` API
`Fragment.setRetainInstance(boolean)` instead; this is also
available on older platforms through the Android support libraries.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Object` | any Object holding the desired state to propagate to the next activity instance |

### onSaveInstanceState

Added in [API level 21](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onSaveInstanceState (Bundle outState, 
                PersistableBundle outPersistentState)
```

This is the same as `onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)` but is called for activities
created with the attribute `R.attr.persistableMode` set to
`persistAcrossReboots`. The `PersistableBundle` passed
in will be saved and presented in `onCreate(Bundle,PersistableBundle)`
the first time that this activity is restarted following the next device reboot or after an
update.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `outState` | `Bundle`: Bundle in which to place your saved state.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `outPersistentState` | `PersistableBundle`: State which will be saved across reboots and updates.   This value cannot be `null`. |

**See also:**

* `onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)`
* `onCreate(Bundle)`
* `onRestoreInstanceState(Bundle,PersistableBundle)`
* `onPause()`

### onSearchRequested

Added in [API level 23](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean onSearchRequested (SearchEvent searchEvent)
```

This hook is called when the user signals the desire to start a search.

You can use this function as a simple way to launch the search UI, in response to a
menu item, search button, or other widgets within your activity. Unless overridden,
calling this function is the same as calling
`startSearch(null, false, null, false)`, which launches
search for the current activity as specified in its manifest, see `SearchManager`.

You can override this function to force global search, e.g. in response to a dedicated
search key, or to block search entirely (by simply returning false).

Note: when running in a `Configuration.UI_MODE_TYPE_TELEVISION` or
`Configuration.UI_MODE_TYPE_WATCH`, the default implementation changes to simply
return false and you must supply your own custom implementation if you want to support
search.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `searchEvent` | `SearchEvent`: The `SearchEvent` that signaled this search.   This value may be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | Returns `true` if search launched, and `false` if the activity does not respond to search. The default implementation always returns `true`, except when in `Configuration.UI_MODE_TYPE_TELEVISION` mode where it returns false. |

**See also:**

* `SearchManager`

### onSearchRequested

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean onSearchRequested ()
```

Called when the user signals the desire to start a search.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | true if search launched, false if activity refuses (blocks) |

**See also:**

* `onSearchRequested(SearchEvent)`

### onStateNotSaved

Added in [API level 23](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
29](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onStateNotSaved ()
```

**This method was deprecated
in API level 29.**  
starting with `Build.VERSION_CODES.P` onSaveInstanceState is
called after `onStop()`, so this hint isn't accurate anymore: you should consider your
state not saved in between `onStart` and `onStop` callbacks inclusively.

Called when an `onResume()` is coming up, prior to other pre-resume callbacks
such as `onNewIntent(Intent)` and `onActivityResult(int, int, Intent)`. This is primarily intended
to give the activity a hint that its state is no longer saved -- it will generally
be called after `onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)` and prior to the activity being
resumed/started again.

### onTopResumedActivityChanged

Added in [API level 29](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onTopResumedActivityChanged (boolean isTopResumedActivity)
```

Called when activity gets or loses the top resumed position in the system.

Starting with `Build.VERSION_CODES.Q` multiple activities can be resumed
at the same time in multi-window and multi-display modes. This callback should be used
instead of `onResume()` as an indication that the activity can try to open
exclusive-access devices like camera.

It will always be delivered after the activity was resumed and before it is paused. In
some cases it might be skipped and activity can go straight from `onResume()` to
`onPause()` without receiving the top resumed state.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `isTopResumedActivity` | `boolean`: `true` if it's the topmost resumed activity in the system, `false` otherwise. A call with this as `true` will always be followed by another one with `false`. |

**See also:**

* `onResume()`
* `onPause()`
* `onWindowFocusChanged(boolean)`

### onTouchEvent

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean onTouchEvent (MotionEvent event)
```

Called when a touch screen event was not handled by any of the views
inside of the activity. This is most useful to process touch events that happen
outside of your window bounds, where there is no view to receive it.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `event` | `MotionEvent`: The touch screen event being processed. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | Return true if you have consumed the event, false if you haven't. |

### onTrackballEvent

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean onTrackballEvent (MotionEvent event)
```

Called when the trackball was moved and not handled by any of the
views inside of the activity. So, for example, if the trackball moves
while focus is on a button, you will receive a call here because
buttons do not normally do anything with trackball events. The call
here happens *before* trackball movements are converted to
DPAD key events, which then get sent back to the view hierarchy, and
will be processed at the point for things like focus navigation.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `event` | `MotionEvent`: The trackball event being processed. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | Return true if you have consumed the event, false if you haven't. The default implementation always returns false. |

### onTrimMemory

Added in [API level 14](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onTrimMemory (int level)
```

Called when the operating system has determined that it is a good
time for a process to trim unneeded memory from its process.
You should never compare to exact values of the level, since new
intermediate values may be added -- you will typically want to compare if
the value is greater or equal to a level you are interested in.

To retrieve the processes current trim level at any point, you can
use `ActivityManager.getMyMemoryState(RunningAppProcessInfo)`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `level` | `int`: The context of the trim, giving a hint of the amount of trimming the application may like to perform.   Value is one of the following:  * `ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_COMPLETE` * `ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_MODERATE` * `ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_BACKGROUND` * `ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_UI_HIDDEN` * `ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_RUNNING_CRITICAL` * `ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_RUNNING_LOW` * `ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_RUNNING_MODERATE` |

### onUserInteraction

Added in [API level 3](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onUserInteraction ()
```

Called whenever a key, touch, or trackball event is dispatched to the
activity. Implement this method if you wish to know that the user has
interacted with the device in some way while your activity is running.
This callback and `onUserLeaveHint()` are intended to help
activities manage status bar notifications intelligently; specifically,
for helping activities determine the proper time to cancel a notification.

All calls to your activity's `onUserLeaveHint()` callback will
be accompanied by calls to `onUserInteraction()`. This
ensures that your activity will be told of relevant user activity such
as pulling down the notification pane and touching an item there.

Note that this callback will be invoked for the touch down action
that begins a touch gesture, but may not be invoked for the touch-moved
and touch-up actions that follow.

**See also:**

* `onUserLeaveHint()`

### onVisibleBehindCanceled

Added in [API level 21](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
26](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onVisibleBehindCanceled ()
```

**This method was deprecated
in API level 26.**  
This method's functionality is no longer supported as of
`Build.VERSION_CODES.O` and will be removed in a future release.

Called when a translucent activity over this activity is becoming opaque or another
activity is being launched. Activities that override this method must call
`super.onVisibleBehindCanceled()` or a SuperNotCalledException will be thrown.

When this method is called the activity has 500 msec to release any resources it may be
using while visible in the background.
If the activity has not returned from this method in 500 msec the system will destroy
the activity and kill the process in order to recover the resources for another
process. Otherwise `onStop()` will be called following return.
  
If you override this method you *must* call through to the
superclass implementation.

**See also:**

* `requestVisibleBehind(boolean)`

### onWindowAttributesChanged

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onWindowAttributesChanged (WindowManager.LayoutParams params)
```

This is called whenever the current window attributes change.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `params` | `WindowManager.LayoutParams` |

### onWindowFocusChanged

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onWindowFocusChanged (boolean hasFocus)
```

Called when the current `Window` of the activity gains or loses
focus. This is the best indicator of whether this activity is the entity
with which the user actively interacts. The default implementation
clears the key tracking state, so should always be called.

Note that this provides information about global focus state, which
is managed independently of activity lifecycle. As such, while focus
changes will generally have some relation to lifecycle changes (an
activity that is stopped will not generally get window focus), you
should not rely on any particular order between the callbacks here and
those in the other lifecycle methods such as `onResume()`.

As a general rule, however, a foreground activity will have window
focus... unless it has displayed other dialogs or popups that take
input focus, in which case the activity itself will not have focus
when the other windows have it. Likewise, the system may display
system-level windows (such as the status bar notification panel or
a system alert) which will temporarily take window input focus without
pausing the foreground activity.

Starting with `Build.VERSION_CODES.Q` there can be
multiple resumed activities at the same time in multi-window mode, so
resumed state does not guarantee window focus even if there are no
overlays above.

If the intent is to know when an activity is the topmost active, the
one the user interacted with last among all activities but not including
non-activity windows like dialogs and popups, then
`onTopResumedActivityChanged(boolean)` should be used. On platform
versions prior to `Build.VERSION_CODES.Q`,
`onResume()` is the best indicator.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `hasFocus` | `boolean`: Whether the window of this activity has focus. |

**See also:**

* `hasWindowFocus()`
* `onResume()`
* `View.onWindowFocusChanged(boolean)`
* `onTopResumedActivityChanged(boolean)`

### onWindowStartingActionMode

Added in [API level 23](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public ActionMode onWindowStartingActionMode (ActionMode.Callback callback, 
                int type)
```

Called when an action mode is being started for this window. Gives the
callback an opportunity to handle the action mode in its own unique and
beautiful way. If this method returns null the system can choose a way
to present the mode or choose not to start the mode at all.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `callback` | `ActionMode.Callback`: Callback to control the lifecycle of this action mode |
| `type` | `int`: One of `ActionMode.TYPE_PRIMARY` or `ActionMode.TYPE_FLOATING`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `ActionMode` | This value may be `null`. |

### onWindowStartingActionMode

Added in [API level 11](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public ActionMode onWindowStartingActionMode (ActionMode.Callback callback)
```

Give the Activity a chance to control the UI for an action mode requested
by the system.

Note: If you are looking for a notification callback that an action mode
has been started for this activity, see `onActionModeStarted(ActionMode)`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `callback` | `ActionMode.Callback`: The callback that should control the new action mode |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `ActionMode` | The new action mode, or `null` if the activity does not want to provide special handling for this action mode. (It will be handled by the system.) |

### openContextMenu

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void openContextMenu (View view)
```

Programmatically opens the context menu for a particular `view`.
The `view` should have been added via
`registerForContextMenu(View)`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `view` | `View`: The view to show the context menu for. |

### openOptionsMenu

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void openOptionsMenu ()
```

Programmatically opens the options menu. If the options menu is already
open, this method does nothing.

### overrideActivityTransition

Added in [API level 34](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void overrideActivityTransition (int overrideType, 
                int enterAnim, 
                int exitAnim, 
                int backgroundColor)
```

Customizes the animation and background color for activity transitions.

This method provides a robust way to override transition animations at runtime and can be
called at any point in the activity's lifecycle. It is particularly useful for handling
predictive back animations, for which `overridePendingTransition(int, int)` is not
suitable.

The specified animations will be applied only when this activity is at the top of the
task stack during the transition. For example, to customize the opening animation for an
Activity B started from Activity A, call this method in B's `onCreate` with
`overrideType = OVERRIDE_TRANSITION_OPEN`. To customize the closing animation when
returning from B to A, call this method in B with
`overrideType = OVERRIDE_TRANSITION_CLOSE`.

**Animation Precedence:**

* Animations set by `overridePendingTransition(int, int)` have the highest
  priority.
* Animations set by this method have higher priority than those defined by
  `Window.setWindowAnimations(int)`.

**Predictive Back Animation:**

When predictive back is enabled (see `enableOnBackInvokedCallback` in the manifest),
the system may control the preview phase of the back animation. The custom transition defined
by `enterAnim` and `exitAnim` is then applied only after the back gesture is
committed.

**Limitations:**

* This method, along with `overridePendingTransition(int, int)` and
  `Window.setWindowAnimations(int)`, is ignored if the activity is started with
  `ActivityOptions.makeSceneTransitionAnimation(Activity,android.util.Pair[])`.
* As of Android 11, this method cannot be used to customize cross-task transitions.

| `overrideType` | `int`: The type of transition to override. Must be either `OVERRIDE_TRANSITION_OPEN` for entering transitions or `OVERRIDE_TRANSITION_CLOSE` for exiting transitions.   Value is one of the following:  * `OVERRIDE_TRANSITION_OPEN` * `OVERRIDE_TRANSITION_CLOSE` |
| `enterAnim` | `int`: The resource ID of the animation for the incoming activity. Use 0 for no animation. |
| `exitAnim` | `int`: The resource ID of the animation for the outgoing activity. Use 0 for no animation. |
| `backgroundColor` | `int`: The background color to display during the animation. Set to `Color.TRANSPARENT` to use the default background color. |

**See also:**

* `overrideActivityTransition(int, int, int)`
* `clearOverrideActivityTransition(int)`
* `OnBackInvokedCallback`
* `overridePendingTransition(int, int)`
* `Window.setWindowAnimations(int)`

### overrideActivityTransition

Added in [API level 34](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void overrideActivityTransition (int overrideType, 
                int enterAnim, 
                int exitAnim)
```

Customizes the animation for activity transitions.

This method provides a robust way to override transition animations at runtime and can be
called at any point in the activity's lifecycle. It is particularly useful for handling
predictive back animations, for which `overridePendingTransition(int, int)` is not
suitable.

The specified animations will be applied only when this activity is at the top of the
task stack during the transition. For example, to customize the opening animation for an
Activity B started from Activity A, call this method in B's `onCreate` with
`overrideType = OVERRIDE_TRANSITION_OPEN`. To customize the closing animation when
returning from B to A, call this method in B with
`overrideType = OVERRIDE_TRANSITION_CLOSE`.

**Animation Precedence:**

* Animations set by `overridePendingTransition(int, int)` have the highest
  priority.
* Animations set by this method have higher priority than those defined by
  `Window.setWindowAnimations(int)`.

**Predictive Back Animation:**

When predictive back is enabled (see `enableOnBackInvokedCallback` in the manifest),
the system may control the preview phase of the back animation. The custom transition defined
by `enterAnim` and `exitAnim` is then applied only after the back gesture is
committed.

**Limitations:**

* This method, along with `overridePendingTransition(int, int)` and
  `Window.setWindowAnimations(int)`, is ignored if the activity is started with
  `ActivityOptions.makeSceneTransitionAnimation(Activity,android.util.Pair[])`.
* As of Android 11, this method cannot be used to customize cross-task transitions.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `overrideType` | `int`: The type of transition to override. Must be either `OVERRIDE_TRANSITION_OPEN` for entering transitions or `OVERRIDE_TRANSITION_CLOSE` for exiting transitions.   Value is one of the following:  * `OVERRIDE_TRANSITION_OPEN` * `OVERRIDE_TRANSITION_CLOSE` |
| `enterAnim` | `int`: The resource ID of the animation for the incoming activity. Use 0 for no animation. |
| `exitAnim` | `int`: The resource ID of the animation for the outgoing activity. Use 0 for no animation. |

**See also:**

* `overrideActivityTransition(int, int, int, int)`
* `clearOverrideActivityTransition(int)`

### overridePendingTransition

Added in [API level 5](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
34](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void overridePendingTransition (int enterAnim, 
                int exitAnim)
```

**This method was deprecated
in API level 34.**  
Use `overrideActivityTransition(int, int, int)`} instead.

Call immediately after one of the flavors of `startActivity(Intent)`
or `finish()` to specify an explicit transition animation to
perform next.

As of `Build.VERSION_CODES.JELLY_BEAN` an alternative
to using this with starting activities is to supply the desired animation
information through a `ActivityOptions` bundle to
`startActivity(Intent,Bundle)` or a related function. This allows
you to specify a custom animation even when starting an activity from
outside the context of the current top activity.

Af of `Build.VERSION_CODES.S` application can only specify
a transition animation when the transition happens within the same task. System
default animation is used for cross-task transition animations.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `enterAnim` | `int`: A resource ID of the animation resource to use for the incoming activity. Use 0 for no animation. |

| `exitAnim` | `int`: A resource ID of the animation resource to use for the outgoing activity. Use 0 for no animation. |

| `exitAnim` | `int`: A resource ID of the animation resource to use for the outgoing activity. Use 0 for no animation. |
| `backgroundColor` | `int`: The background color to use for the background during the animation if the animation requires a background. Set to 0 to not override the default color. |

### postponeEnterTransition

Added in [API level 21](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void postponeEnterTransition ()
```

Postpone the entering activity transition when Activity was started with
`android.app.ActivityOptions.makeSceneTransitionAnimation(Activity,android.util.Pair[])`.

This method gives the Activity the ability to delay starting the entering and
shared element transitions until all data is loaded. Until then, the Activity won't
draw into its window, leaving the window transparent. This may also cause the
returning animation to be delayed until data is ready. This method should be
called in `onCreate(android.os.Bundle)` or in
`onActivityReenter(int, android.content.Intent)`.
`startPostponedEnterTransition()` must be called to allow the Activity to
start the transitions. If the Activity did not use
`android.app.ActivityOptions.makeSceneTransitionAnimation(Activity,android.util.Pair[])`, then this method does nothing.

### recreate

Added in [API level 11](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void recreate ()
```

Cause this Activity to be recreated with a new instance. This results
in essentially the same flow as when the Activity is created due to
a configuration change -- the current instance will go through its
lifecycle to `onDestroy()` and a new instance then created after it.

### registerActivityLifecycleCallbacks

Added in [API level 29](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void registerActivityLifecycleCallbacks (Application.ActivityLifecycleCallbacks callback)
```

Register an `Application.ActivityLifecycleCallbacks` instance that receives
lifecycle callbacks for only this Activity.

In relation to any
`Application registered callbacks`,
the callbacks registered here will always occur nested within those callbacks. This means:

* Pre events will first be sent to Application registered callbacks, then to callbacks
  registered here.
* `Application.ActivityLifecycleCallbacks.onActivityCreated(Activity,Bundle)`,
  `Application.ActivityLifecycleCallbacks.onActivityStarted(Activity)`, and
  `Application.ActivityLifecycleCallbacks.onActivityResumed(Activity)` will
  be sent first to Application registered callbacks, then to callbacks registered here.
  For all other events, callbacks registered here will be sent first.
* Post events will first be sent to callbacks registered here, then to
  Application registered callbacks.

If multiple callbacks are registered here, they receive events in a first in (up through
`Application.ActivityLifecycleCallbacks.onActivityPostResumed`, last out
ordering.

It is strongly recommended to register this in the constructor of your Activity to ensure
you get all available callbacks. As this callback is associated with only this Activity,
it is not usually necessary to `unregister` it
unless you specifically do not want to receive further lifecycle callbacks.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `callback` | `Application.ActivityLifecycleCallbacks`: The callback instance to register.   This value cannot be `null`. |

### registerComponentCallbacks

Added in [API level 14](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void registerComponentCallbacks (ComponentCallbacks callback)
```

Add a new `ComponentCallbacks` to the base application of the
Context, which will be called at the same times as the ComponentCallbacks
methods of activities and other components are called. Note that you
*must* be sure to use `unregisterComponentCallbacks(ComponentCallbacks)` when
appropriate in the future; this will not be removed for you.

After `Build.VERSION_CODES.TIRAMISU`, the `ComponentCallbacks` will be registered
to `the base Context`, and can be only used after
`attachBaseContext(Context)`. Users can still call to
`getApplicationContext().registerComponentCallbacks(ComponentCallbacks)` to add
`ComponentCallbacks` to the base application.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `callback` | `ComponentCallbacks`: The interface to call. This can be either a `ComponentCallbacks` or `ComponentCallbacks2` interface. |

### registerForContextMenu

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void registerForContextMenu (View view)
```

Registers a context menu to be shown for the given view (multiple views
can show the context menu). This method will set the
`OnCreateContextMenuListener` on the view to this activity, so
`onCreateContextMenu(ContextMenu,View,ContextMenuInfo)` will be
called when it is time to show the context menu.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `view` | `View`: The view that should show a context menu. |

**See also:**

* `unregisterForContextMenu(View)`

### registerScreenCaptureCallback

Added in [API level 34](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void registerScreenCaptureCallback (Executor executor, 
                Activity.ScreenCaptureCallback callback)
```

Registers a screen capture callback for this activity.
The callback will be triggered when a screen capture of this activity is attempted.
This callback will be executed on the thread of the passed `executor`.
For details, see `ScreenCaptureCallback.onScreenCaptured`.
  
Requires `Manifest.permission.DETECT_SCREEN_CAPTURE`

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `executor` | `Executor`: This value cannot be `null`.   Callback and listener events are dispatched through this `Executor`, providing an easy way to control which thread is used. To dispatch events through the main thread of your application, you can use `Context.getMainExecutor()`. Otherwise, provide an `Executor` that dispatches to an appropriate thread. |
| `callback` | `Activity.ScreenCaptureCallback`: This value cannot be `null`. |

### releaseInstance

Added in [API level 21](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean releaseInstance ()
```

Ask that the local app instance of this activity be released to free up its memory.
This is asking for the activity to be destroyed, but does **not** finish the activity --
a new instance of the activity will later be re-created if needed due to the user
navigating back to it.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | Returns true if the activity was in a state that it has started the process of destroying its current instance; returns false if for any reason this could not be done: it is currently visible to the user, it is already being destroyed, it is being finished, it hasn't yet saved its state, etc. |

### removeDialog

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
15](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public final void removeDialog (int id)
```

**This method was deprecated
in API level 15.**  
Use the new `DialogFragment` class with
`FragmentManager` instead; this is also
available on older platforms through the Android compatibility package.

Removes any internal references to a dialog managed by this Activity.
If the dialog is showing, it will dismiss it as part of the clean up.

This can be useful if you know that you will never show a dialog again and
want to avoid the overhead of saving and restoring it in the future.

As of `Build.VERSION_CODES.GINGERBREAD`, this function
will not throw an exception if you try to remove an ID that does not
currently have an associated dialog.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | `int`: The id of the managed dialog. |

**See also:**

* `onCreateDialog(int,Bundle)`
* `onPrepareDialog(int,Dialog,Bundle)`
* `showDialog(int)`
* `dismissDialog(int)`

### reportFullyDrawn

Added in [API level 19](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void reportFullyDrawn ()
```

Report to the system that your app is now fully drawn, for diagnostic and
optimization purposes. The system may adjust optimizations to prioritize
work that happens before reportFullyDrawn is called, to improve app startup.
Misrepresenting the startup window by calling reportFullyDrawn too late or too
early may decrease application and startup performance.

This is also used to help instrument application launch times, so that the
app can report when it is fully in a usable state; without this, the only thing
the system itself can determine is the point at which the activity's window
is *first* drawn and displayed. To participate in app launch time
measurement, you should always call this method after first launch (when
`onCreate(android.os.Bundle)` is called), at the point where you have
entirely drawn your UI and populated with all of the significant data. You
can safely call this method any time after first launch as well, in which case
it will simply be ignored.

If this method is called before the activity's window is *first* drawn
and displayed as measured by the system, the reported time here will be shifted
to the system measured time.

### requestDragAndDropPermissions

Added in [API level 24](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public DragAndDropPermissions requestDragAndDropPermissions (DragEvent event)
```

Create `DragAndDropPermissions` object bound to this activity and controlling the
access permissions for content URIs associated with the `DragEvent`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `event` | `DragEvent`: Drag event |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `DragAndDropPermissions` | The `DragAndDropPermissions` object used to control access to the content URIs. Null if no content URIs are associated with the event or if permissions could not be granted. |

### requestFullscreenMode

Added in [API level 34](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void requestFullscreenMode (int request, 
                OutcomeReceiver<Void, Throwable> approvalCallback)
```

Request to put the activity into fullscreen. The requester must be pinned or the top-most
activity of the focused display which can be verified using
`onTopResumedActivityChanged(boolean)`. The request should also be a response to a
user input. When getting fullscreen and receiving corresponding
`onConfigurationChanged(Configuration)` and
`onMultiWindowModeChanged(boolean,Configuration)`, the activity should relayout
itself and the system bars' visibilities can be controlled as usual fullscreen apps.
Calling it again with the exit request can restore the activity to the previous status.
This will only happen when it got into fullscreen through this API.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `request` | `int`: Can be `FULLSCREEN_MODE_REQUEST_ENTER` or `FULLSCREEN_MODE_REQUEST_EXIT` to indicate this request is to get fullscreen or get restored.   Value is one of the following:  * `FULLSCREEN_MODE_REQUEST_EXIT` * `FULLSCREEN_MODE_REQUEST_ENTER` |
| `approvalCallback` | `OutcomeReceiver`: Optional callback, use `null` when not necessary. When the request is approved or rejected, the callback will be triggered. This will happen before any configuration change. The callback will be dispatched on the main thread except on devices with API level 36.1 or lower, where the behavior is undefined. If the request is rejected, the Throwable provided will be an `IllegalStateException` with a detailed message can be retrieved by `Throwable.getMessage()`. |

### requestOpenInBrowserEducation

Added in [API level 36](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public final void requestOpenInBrowserEducation ()
```

Requests to show the \u201cOpen in browser\u201d education. \u201cOpen in browser\u201d is a feature
within the app header that allows users to switch from an app to the web. The feature
is made available when an application is opened by a user clicking a link or when a
link is provided by an application. Links can be provided by calling
`AssistContent.setSessionTransferUri` or
`AssistContent.setWebUri`.

This method should be utilized when an activity wants to nudge the user to switch
to the web application in cases where the web may provide the user with a better
experience. Note that this method does not guarantee that the education will be shown.

The number of times that the "Open in browser" education can be triggered by this method
is limited per application, and, when shown, the education appears above the app's content.
For these reasons, developers should use this method sparingly when it is least
disruptive to the user to show the education and when it is optimal to switch the user to a
browser session. Before requesting to show the education, developers should assert that they
have set a link that can be used by the "Open in browser" feature through either
`AssistContent.setSessionTransferUri` or
`AssistContent.setWebUri` so that users are navigated to a relevant page if they choose
to switch to the browser. If a URI is not set using either method, "Open in browser" will
utilize a generic link if available which will direct users to the homepage of the site
associated with the app. The generic link is provided for a limited number of applications by
the system and cannot be edited by developers. If none of these options contains a valid URI,
the user will not be provided with the option to switch to the browser and the education will
not be shown if requested.

**See also:**

* `AssistContent.setSessionTransferUri(Uri)`

### requestPermissions

Added in [API level 35](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public final void requestPermissions (String[] permissions, 
                int requestCode, 
                int deviceId)
```

Requests permissions to be granted to this application. These permissions
must be requested in your manifest, they should not be granted to your app,
and they should have protection level `dangerous`, regardless
whether they are declared by the platform or a third-party app.

Normal permissions `PermissionInfo.PROTECTION_NORMAL`
are granted at install time if requested in the manifest. Signature permissions
`PermissionInfo.PROTECTION_SIGNATURE` are granted at
install time if requested in the manifest and the signature of your app matches
the signature of the app declaring the permissions.

Call `shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale(String)` before calling this API to
check if the system recommends to show a rationale UI before asking for a permission.

If your app does not have the requested permissions the user will be presented
with UI for accepting them. After the user has accepted or rejected the
requested permissions you will receive a callback on `onRequestPermissionsResult(int, String, int)`
reporting whether the permissions were granted or not.

Note that requesting a permission does not guarantee it will be granted and
your app should be able to run without having this permission.

This method may start an activity allowing the user to choose which permissions
to grant and which to reject. Hence, you should be prepared that your activity
may be paused and resumed. Further, granting some permissions may require
a restart of you application. In such a case, the system will recreate the
activity stack before delivering the result to `onRequestPermissionsResult(int, String, int)`.

When checking whether you have a permission you should use `checkSelfPermission(String)`.

You cannot request a permission if your activity sets `noHistory` to
`true` because in this case the activity would not receive
result callbacks including `onRequestPermissionsResult(int, String, int)`.

The [permissions samples](https://github.com/android/platform-samples/tree/main/samples/privacy/permissions) repo demonstrates how to use this method to
request permissions at run time.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `permissions` | `String`: The requested permissions. Must be non-null and not empty. |
| `requestCode` | `int`: Application specific request code to match with a result reported to `onRequestPermissionsResult(int, String, int)`. Should be >= 0. |
| `deviceId` | `int`: The app is requesting permissions for this device. The primary/physical device is assigned `Context.DEVICE_ID_DEFAULT`, and virtual devices are assigned unique device Ids. |

| Throws | |
| --- | --- |
| `IllegalArgumentException` | if requestCode is negative. |

**See also:**

* `onRequestPermissionsResult(int, String, int)`
* `ContextWrapper.checkSelfPermission(String)`
* `shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale(String)`

### requestPermissions

Added in [API level 23](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public final void requestPermissions (String[] permissions, 
                int requestCode)
```

Requests permissions to be granted to this application. These permissions
must be requested in your manifest, they should not be granted to your app,
and they should have protection level `dangerous`, regardless
whether they are declared by the platform or a third-party app.

Normal permissions `PermissionInfo.PROTECTION_NORMAL`
are granted at install time if requested in the manifest. Signature permissions
`PermissionInfo.PROTECTION_SIGNATURE` are granted at
install time if requested in the manifest and the signature of your app matches
the signature of the app declaring the permissions.

Call `shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale(String)` before calling this API to
check if the system recommends to show a rationale UI before asking for a permission.

If your app does not have the requested permissions the user will be presented
with UI for accepting them. After the user has accepted or rejected the
requested permissions you will receive a callback on `onRequestPermissionsResult(int, String, int)` reporting whether the
permissions were granted or not.

Note that requesting a permission does not guarantee it will be granted and
your app should be able to run without having this permission.

This method may start an activity allowing the user to choose which permissions
to grant and which to reject. Hence, you should be prepared that your activity
may be paused and resumed. Further, granting some permissions may require

### requestShowKeyboardShortcuts

Added in [API level 24](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public final void requestShowKeyboardShortcuts ()
```

Request the Keyboard Shortcuts screen to show up. This will trigger
`onProvideKeyboardShortcuts(List, Menu, int)` to retrieve the shortcuts for the foreground activity.

### requestVisibleBehind

Added in [API level 21](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
26](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean requestVisibleBehind (boolean visible)
```

**This method was deprecated
in API level 26.**  
This method's functionality is no longer supported as of
`Build.VERSION_CODES.O` and will be removed in a future release.

Activities that want to remain visible behind a translucent activity above them must call
this method anytime between the start of `onResume()` and the return from
`onPause()`. If this call is successful then the activity will remain visible after
`onPause()` is called, and is allowed to continue playing media in the background.

The actions of this call are reset each time that this activity is brought to the
front. That is, every time `onResume()` is called the activity will be assumed
to not have requested visible behind. Therefore, if you want this activity to continue to
be visible in the background you must call this method again.

Only fullscreen opaque activities may make this call. I.e. this call is a nop
for dialog and translucent activities.

Under all circumstances, the activity must stop playing and release resources prior to or
within a call to `onVisibleBehindCanceled()` or if this call returns false.

False will be returned any time this method is called between the return of onPause and
the next call to onResume.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `visible` | `boolean`: true to notify the system that the activity wishes to be visible behind other translucent activities, false to indicate otherwise. Resources must be released when passing false to this method. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | the resulting visibiity state. If true the activity will remain visible beyond `onPause()` if the next activity is translucent or not fullscreen. If false then the activity may not count on being visible behind other translucent activities, and must stop any media playback and release resources. Returning false may occur in lieu of a call to `onVisibleBehindCanceled()` so the return value must be checked. |

**See also:**

* `onVisibleBehindCanceled()`

### requestWindowFeature

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public final boolean requestWindowFeature (int featureId)
```

Enable extended window features. This is a convenience for calling
`getWindow().requestFeature()`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `featureId` | `int`: The desired feature as defined in `Window`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | Returns true if the requested feature is supported and now enabled. |

**See also:**

* `Window.requestFeature(int)`

### requireViewById

Added in [API level 28](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public final T requireViewById (int id)
```

Finds a view that was identified by the `android:id` XML attribute that was processed
in `onCreate(Bundle)`, or throws an IllegalArgumentException if the ID is invalid, or there is
no matching view in the hierarchy.

**Note:** In most cases -- depending on compiler support --
the resulting view is automatically cast to the target class type. If
the target class type is unconstrained, an explicit cast may be
necessary.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | `int`: the ID to search for |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `T` | a view with given ID.   This value cannot be `null`. |

**See also:**

* `View.requireViewById(int)`
* `Activity.findViewById(int)`

### runOnUiThread

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public final void runOnUiThread (Runnable action)
```

Runs the specified action on the UI thread. If the current thread is the UI
thread, then the action is executed immediately. If the current thread is
not the UI thread, the action is posted to the event queue of the UI thread.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `action` | `Runnable`: the action to run on the UI thread |

### setActionBar

Added in [API level 21](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void setActionBar (Toolbar toolbar)
```

Set a `Toolbar` to act as the `ActionBar` for this
Activity window.

When set to a non-null value the `getActionBar()` method will return
an `ActionBar` object that can be used to control the given toolbar as if it were
a traditional window decor action bar. The toolbar's menu will be populated with the
Activity's options menu and the navigation button will be wired through the standard
`home` menu select action.

In order to use a Toolbar within the Activity's window content the application
must not request the window feature `FEATURE_ACTION_BAR`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `toolbar` | `Toolbar`: Toolbar to set as the Activity's action bar, or `null` to clear it |

### setAllowCrossUidActivitySwitchFromBelow

Added in [API level 35](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void setAllowCrossUidActivitySwitchFromBelow (boolean allowed)
```

Specifies whether the activities below this one in the task can also start other activities
or finish the task.

Starting from Target SDK Level `Build.VERSION_CODES.VANILLA_ICE_CREAM`, apps
may be blocked from starting new activities or finishing their task unless the top activity
of such task belong to the same UID for security reasons.

Setting this flag to `true` will allow the launching app to ignore the restriction if
this activity is on top. Apps matching the UID of this activity are always exempt.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `allowed` | `boolean`: `true` to disable the UID restrictions; `false` to revert back to the default behaviour |

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void setContentView (View view, 
                ViewGroup.LayoutParams params)
```

Set the activity content to an explicit view. This view is placed
directly into the activity's view hierarchy. It can itself be a complex
view hierarchy.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `view` | `View`: The desired content to display. |
| `params` | `ViewGroup.LayoutParams`: Layout parameters for the view. |

**See also:**

* `setContentView(android.view.View)`

### setContentView

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void setContentView (View view)
```

Set the activity content to an explicit view. This view is placed
directly into the activity's view hierarchy. It can itself be a complex
view hierarchy. When calling this method, the layout parameters of the
specified view are ignored. Both the width and the height of the view are
set by default to `ViewGroup.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT`. To use
your own layout parameters, invoke
`setContentView(android.view.View, android.view.ViewGroup.LayoutParams)`
instead.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `view` | `View`: The desired content to display. |

**See also:**

* `setContentView(int)`
* `setContentView(android.view.View, android.view.ViewGroup.LayoutParams)`

### setContentView

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

### setDefaultKeyMode

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public final void setDefaultKeyMode (int mode)
```

Select the default key handling for this activity. This controls what
will happen to key events that are not otherwise handled. The default
mode (`DEFAULT_KEYS_DISABLE`) will simply drop them on the
floor. Other modes allow you to launch the dialer
(`DEFAULT_KEYS_DIALER`), execute a shortcut in your options
menu without requiring the menu key be held down
(`DEFAULT_KEYS_SHORTCUT`), or launch a search (`DEFAULT_KEYS_SEARCH_LOCAL`
and `DEFAULT_KEYS_SEARCH_GLOBAL`).

Note that the mode selected here does not impact the default
handling of system keys, such as the "back" and "menu" keys, and your
activity and its views always get a first chance to receive and handle
all application keys.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `mode` | `int`: The desired default key mode constant.   Value is one of the following:  * `DEFAULT_KEYS_DISABLE` * `DEFAULT_KEYS_DIALER` * `DEFAULT_KEYS_SHORTCUT` * `DEFAULT_KEYS_SEARCH_LOCAL` * `DEFAULT_KEYS_SEARCH_GLOBAL` |

Note that changing this value will have no effect on the activity's
`ActivityInfo` structure; that is, if
`android:immersive` is set to `true`
in the application's manifest entry for this activity, the `ActivityInfo.flags` member will
always have its `FLAG_IMMERSIVE` bit set.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |

the lockscreen is up and this activity has another activity behind it with the showWhenLock
attribute set. That is, this activity is only visible on the lock screen if there is another
activity with the showWhenLock attribute visible at the same time on the lock screen. A use
case for this is permission dialogs, that should only be visible on the lock screen if their
requesting activity is also visible. This value can be set as a manifest attribute using
android.R.attr#inheritShowWhenLocked.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `inheritShowWhenLocked` | `boolean`: `true` to show the `Activity` on top of the lock screen when this activity has another activity behind it with the showWhenLock attribute set; `false` otherwise. |

**See also:**

* `setShowWhenLocked(boolean)`
* `R.attr.inheritShowWhenLocked`

### setIntent

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void setIntent (Intent newIntent)
```

Changes the intent returned by `getIntent()`. This holds a
reference to the given intent; it does not copy it. Often used in
conjunction with `onNewIntent(Intent)`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `newIntent` | `Intent`: The new Intent object to return from `getIntent()` |

**See also:**

* `getIntent()`
* `onNewIntent(Intent)`

### setIntent

Added in [API level 35](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void setIntent (Intent newIntent, 
                ComponentCaller newCaller)
```

Changes the intent returned by `getIntent()`, and ComponentCaller returned by
`getCaller()`. This holds references to the given intent, and ComponentCaller; it does
not copy them. Often used in conjunction with `onNewIntent(Intent)`. To retrieve the
caller from `onNewIntent(Intent)`, use `getCurrentCaller()`, otherwise override
`onNewIntent(Intent,ComponentCaller)`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `newIntent` | `Intent`: The new Intent object to return from `getIntent()`   This value may be `null`. |
| `newCaller` | `ComponentCaller`: The new `ComponentCaller` object to return from `getCaller()`   This value may be `null`. |

* `onNewIntent(Intent,ComponentCaller)`
* `getCaller()`

### setLocusContext

Added in [API level 30](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void setLocusContext (LocusId locusId, 
                Bundle bundle)
```

Sets the `LocusId` for this activity. The locus id
helps identify different instances of the same `Activity` class.

For example, a locus id based on a specific conversation could be set on a
conversation app's chat `Activity`. The system can then use this locus id
along with app's contents to provide ranking signals in various UI surfaces
including sharing, notifications, shortcuts and so on.

It is recommended to set the same locus id in the shortcut's locus id using
`setLocusId`
so that the system can learn appropriate ranking signals linking the activity's
locus id with the matching shortcut.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `locusId` | `LocusId`: a unique, stable id that identifies this `Activity` instance. LocusId is an opaque ID that links this Activity's state to different Android concepts: `setLocusId`. LocusID is null by default or if you explicitly reset it. |

| `bundle` | `Bundle`: extras set or updated as part of this locus context. This may help provide additional metadata such as URLs, conversation participants specific to this `Activity`'s context. Bundle can be null if additional metadata is not needed. Bundle should always be null for null locusId. |

**See also:**

* `ContentCaptureManager`
* `ContentCaptureContext`

### setMediaController

Added in [API level 21](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public final void setMediaController (MediaController controller)
```

Sets a `MediaController` to send media keys and volume changes to.

The controller will be tied to the window of this Activity. Media key and
volume events which are received while the Activity is in the foreground
will be forwarded to the controller and used to invoke transport controls
or adjust the volume. This may be used instead of or in addition to
`setVolumeControlStream(int)` to affect a specific session instead of a
specific stream.

It is not guaranteed that the hardware volume controls will always change
this session's volume (for example, if a call is in progress, its
stream's volume may be changed instead). To reset back to the default use
null as the controller.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `controller` | `MediaController`: The controller for the session which should receive media keys and volume changes. |

### setPictureInPictureParams

Added in [API level 26](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

`enterPictureInPictureMode()` is called.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `params` | `PictureInPictureParams`: the new parameters for the picture-in-picture.   This value cannot be `null`. |

### setRecentsScreenshotEnabled

Added in [API level 33](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void setRecentsScreenshotEnabled (boolean enabled)
```

If set to false, this indicates to the system that it should never take a
screenshot of the activity to be used as a representation in recents screen. By default, this
value is `true`.

Note that the system may use the window background of the theme instead to represent
the window when it is not running.

Also note that in comparison to `WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_SECURE`,
this only affects the behavior when the activity's screenshot would be used as a
representation when the activity is not in a started state, i.e. in Overview. The system may
still take screenshots of the activity in other contexts; for example, when the user takes a
screenshot of the entire screen, or when the active
`VoiceInteractionService` requests a screenshot via
`VoiceInteractionSession.SHOW_WITH_SCREENSHOT`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `boolean`: `true` to enable recents screenshots; `false` otherwise. |

### setRequestedOrientation

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void setRequestedOrientation (int requestedOrientation)
```

Change the desired orientation of this activity. If the activity is currently in the
foreground or otherwise impacting the screen orientation, the screen is immediately changed
(possibly causing the activity to be restarted). Otherwise, the new orientation is used the
next time the activity is visible.
**Note:**

* To improve the layout of apps on form factors with smallest width >= 600dp, the
  system ignores calls to this method for apps that target Android 16 (API level
  36) or higher.
* Device manufacturers can configure devices to ignore calls to this method to
  improve the layout of orientation-restricted apps.
* On devices with Android 16 (API level 36) or higher installed, virtual device
  owners (select trusted and privileged apps) can optimize app layout on displays
  they manage by ignoring calls to this method. See also
  [Companion app streaming](https://source.android.com/docs/core/permissions/app-streaming).

See [Device
compatibility mode](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/device-compatibility-mode).

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `requestedOrientation` | `int`: An orientation constant as used in `ActivityInfo.screenOrientation`.   Value is one of the following:  * `ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_UNSPECIFIED` * `ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE` * `ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT` * `ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_USER` * `ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_BEHIND` * `ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_SENSOR` * `ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_NOSENSOR` * `ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_SENSOR_LANDSCAPE` * `ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_SENSOR_PORTRAIT` * `ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_REVERSE_LANDSCAPE` * `ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_REVERSE_PORTRAIT` * `ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_FULL_SENSOR` * `ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_USER_LANDSCAPE` * `ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_USER_PORTRAIT` * `ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_FULL_USER` * `ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_LOCKED` |

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public final void setResult (int resultCode, 
                Intent data)
```

Call this to set the result that your activity will return to its
caller.

As of `Build.VERSION_CODES.GINGERBREAD`, the Intent
you supply here can have `Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION` and/or `Intent.FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION` set. This will grant the
Activity receiving the result access to the specific URIs in the Intent.
Access will remain until the Activity has finished (it will remain across the hosting
process being killed and other temporary destruction) and will be added
to any existing set of URI permissions it already holds.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `resultCode` | `int`: The result code to propagate back to the originating activity, often RESULT\_CANCELED or RESULT\_OK |
| `data` | `Intent`: The data to propagate back to the originating activity. |

```
public final void setSecondaryProgress (int secondaryProgress)
```

**This method was deprecated
in API level 24.**  
No longer supported starting in API 21.

Sets the secondary progress for the progress bar in the title. This
progress is drawn between the primary progress (set via
`setProgress(int)` and the background. It can be ideal for media
scenarios such as showing the buffering progress while the default
progress shows the play progress.

In order for the progress bar to be shown, the feature must be requested
via `requestWindowFeature(int)`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `secondaryProgress` | `int`: The secondary progress for the progress bar. Valid ranges are from 0 to 10000 (both inclusive). |

```
public void setShouldDockBigOverlays (boolean shouldDockBigOverlays)
```

Specifies a preference to dock big overlays like the expanded picture-in-picture on TV
(see `PictureInPictureParams.Builder.setExpandedAspectRatio`). Docking puts the
big overlay side-by-side next to this activity, so that both windows are fully visible to
the user.

If unspecified, whether the overlay window will be docked or not, will be defined
by the system.

If specified, the system will try to respect the preference, but it may be
overridden by a user preference.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |

### setShowWhenLocked

Added in [API level 27](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void setShowWhenLocked (boolean showWhenLocked)
```

Specifies whether an `Activity` should be shown on top of the lock screen whenever
the lockscreen is up and the activity is resumed. Normally an activity will be transitioned
to the stopped state if it is started while the lockscreen is up, but with this flag set the
activity will remain in the resumed state visible on-top of the lock screen. This value can
be set as a manifest attribute using `R.attr.showWhenLocked`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `showWhenLocked` | `boolean`: `true` to show the `Activity` on top of the lock screen; `false` otherwise. |

**See also:**

* `setTurnScreenOn(boolean)`

```

Sets information describing the task with this activity for presentation inside the Recents
System UI. When `ActivityManager.getRecentTasks` is called, the activities of each task
are traversed in order from the topmost activity to the bottommost. The traversal continues
for each property until a suitable value is found. For each task the taskDescription will be
returned in `ActivityManager.TaskDescription`.

| Parameters | |

| `boolean` | The result of setting translucency. Return `true` if set successfully, `false` otherwise. |

### setTurnScreenOn

Added in [API level 27](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void setTurnScreenOn (boolean turnScreenOn)
```

Specifies whether the screen should be turned on when the `Activity` is resumed.
Normally an activity will be transitioned to the stopped state if it is started while the
screen if off, but with this flag set the activity will cause the screen to turn on if the
activity will be visible and resumed due to the screen coming on. The screen will not be
turned on if the activity won't be visible after the screen is turned on. This flag is
normally used in conjunction with the `R.attr.showWhenLocked` flag to make sure
the activity is visible after the screen is turned on when the lockscreen is up. In addition,
if this flag is set and the activity calls `KeyguardManager.requestDismissKeyguard(Activity,KeyguardManager.KeyguardDismissCallback)`
the screen will turn on.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `turnScreenOn` | `boolean`: `true` to turn on the screen; `false` otherwise. |

**See also:**

* `setShowWhenLocked(boolean)`
* `R.attr.turnScreenOn`
* `R.attr.showWhenLocked`
* `KeyguardManager.isDeviceSecure()`

### setVisible

Added in [API level 3](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void setVisible (boolean visible)
```

Control whether this activity's main window is visible. This is intended
only for the special case of an activity that is not going to show a
UI itself, but can't just finish prior to onResume() because it needs
to wait for a service binding or such. Setting this to false allows
you to prevent your UI from being shown during that time.

The default value for this is taken from the
`R.attr.windowNoDisplay` attribute of the activity's theme.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `visible` | `boolean` |

### setVolumeControlStream

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public final void setVolumeControlStream (int streamType)
```

Suggests an audio stream whose volume should be changed by the hardware
volume controls.

The suggested audio stream will be tied to the window of this Activity.
Volume requests which are received while the Activity is in the
foreground will affect this stream.

It is not guaranteed that the hardware volume controls will always change
this stream's volume (for example, if a call is in progress, its stream's
volume may be changed instead). To reset back to the default, use
`AudioManager.USE_DEFAULT_STREAM_TYPE`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `streamType` | `int`: The type of the audio stream whose volume should be changed by the hardware volume controls. |

### setVrModeEnabled

Added in [API level 24](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void setVrModeEnabled (boolean enabled, 
                ComponentName requestedComponent)
```

Enable or disable virtual reality (VR) mode for this Activity.

VR mode is a hint to Android system to switch to a mode optimized for VR applications
while this Activity has user focus.

It is recommended that applications additionally declare
`R.attr.enableVrMode` in their manifest to allow for smooth activity
transitions when switching between VR activities.

If the requested `VrListenerService` component is not available,
VR mode will not be started. Developers can handle this case as follows:

```
String servicePackage = "com.whatever.app";
String serviceClass = "com.whatever.app.MyVrListenerService";

// Name of the component of the VrListenerService to start.
ComponentName serviceComponent = new ComponentName(servicePackage, serviceClass);

try {
   setVrModeEnabled(true, myComponentName);
} catch (PackageManager.NameNotFoundException e) {
       List<ApplicationInfo> installed = getPackageManager().getInstalledApplications(0);
       boolean isInstalled = false;
       for (ApplicationInfo app : installed) {
           if (app.packageName.equals(servicePackage)) {
               isInstalled = true;
               break;
           }
       }
       if (isInstalled) {
           // Package is installed, but not enabled in Settings.  Let user enable it.
           startActivity(new Intent(Settings.ACTION_VR_LISTENER_SETTINGS));
       } else {
           // Package is not installed.  Send an intent to download this.
           sentIntentToLaunchAppStore(servicePackage);
       }
}
```

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `boolean`: `true` to enable this mode. |
| `requestedComponent` | `ComponentName`: the name of the component to use as a `VrListenerService` while VR mode is enabled.   This value cannot be `null`. |

| Throws | |
| --- | --- |
| `PackageManager.NameNotFoundException` | if the given component to run as a `VrListenerService` is not installed, or has not been enabled in user settings. |

### shouldUpRecreateTask

Added in [API level 16](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean shouldUpRecreateTask (Intent targetIntent)
```

Returns true if the app should recreate the task when navigating 'up' from this activity
by using targetIntent.

If this method returns false the app can trivially call
`navigateUpTo(Intent)` using the same parameters to correctly perform
up navigation. If this method returns false, the app should synthesize a new task stack
by using `TaskStackBuilder` or another similar mechanism to perform up navigation.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `targetIntent` | `Intent`: An intent representing the target destination for up navigation |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | true if navigating up should recreate a new task stack, false if the same task should be used for the destination |

### showAssist

Added in [API level 23](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean showAssist (Bundle args)
```

Ask to have the current assistant shown to the user. This only works if the calling
activity is the current foreground activity. It is the same as calling
`VoiceInteractionService.showSession` and requesting all of the possible context.
The receiver will always see
`VoiceInteractionSession.SHOW_SOURCE_APPLICATION` set.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `args` | `Bundle` |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | Returns true if the assistant was successfully invoked, else false. For example false will be returned if the caller is not the current top activity. |

### showDialog

Added in [API level 8](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
15](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public final boolean showDialog (int id, 
                Bundle args)
```

**This method was deprecated
in API level 15.**  
Use the new `DialogFragment` class with
`FragmentManager` instead; this is also
available on older platforms through the Android compatibility package.

Show a dialog managed by this activity. A call to `onCreateDialog(int,Bundle)`
will be made with the same id the first time this is called for a given
id. From thereafter, the dialog will be automatically saved and restored.
*If you are targeting `Build.VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB`
or later, consider instead using a `DialogFragment` instead.*

Each time a dialog is shown, `onPrepareDialog(int,Dialog,Bundle)` will
be made to provide an opportunity to do any timely preparation.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | `int`: The id of the managed dialog. |

| `args` | `Bundle`: Arguments to pass through to the dialog. These will be saved and restored for you. Note that if the dialog is already created, `onCreateDialog(int,Bundle)` will not be called with the new arguments but `onPrepareDialog(int,Dialog,Bundle)` will be. If you need to rebuild the dialog, call `removeDialog(int)` first. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | Returns true if the Dialog was created; false is returned if it is not created because `onCreateDialog(int,Bundle)` returns false. |

**See also:**

* `Dialog`
* `onCreateDialog(int,Bundle)`
* `onPrepareDialog(int,Dialog,Bundle)`
* `dismissDialog(int)`

```

Launch a new activity. You will not receive any information about when
the activity exits. This implementation overrides the base version,
providing information about
the activity performing the launch. Because of this additional
information, the `Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK` launch flag is not
required; if not specified, the new activity will be added to the
task of the caller.

### startActivity

Added in [API level 16](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void startActivity (Intent intent, 
                Bundle options)
```

Launch a new activity. You will not receive any information about when
the activity exits. This implementation overrides the base version,
providing information about
the activity performing the launch. Because of this additional
information, the `Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK` launch flag is not
required; if not specified, the new activity will be added to the
task of the caller.

This method throws `ActivityNotFoundException`
if there was no Activity found to run the given Intent.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `intent` | `Intent`: The intent to start. |
| `options` | `Bundle`: Additional options for how the Activity should be started. See `android.content.Context.startActivity(Intent,Bundle)` Context.startActivity(Intent, Bundle)} for more details.   This value may be `null`. |

**See also:**

* `startActivity(Intent)`
* `startActivityForResult(Intent, int)`

### startActivityForResult

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void startActivityForResult (Intent intent, 
                int requestCode)
```

Same as calling `startActivityForResult(Intent,int,Bundle)`
with no options.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `intent` | `Intent`: The intent to start. |
| `requestCode` | `int`: If >= 0, this code will be returned in onActivityResult() when the activity exits; If < 0, no result will return when the activity exits. |

| Throws | |
| --- | --- |
|  | android.content.ActivityNotFoundException |

**See also:**

* `startActivity(Intent)`

### startActivityForResult

Added in [API level 16](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void startActivityForResult (Intent intent, 
                int requestCode, 
                Bundle options)
```

Launch an activity for which you would like a result when it finished.
When this activity exits, your
onActivityResult() method will be called with the given requestCode.
Using a negative requestCode is the same as calling
`startActivity(Intent)` (the activity is not launched as a sub-activity).

Note that this method should only be used with Intent protocols
that are defined to return a result. In other protocols (such as
`Intent.ACTION_MAIN` or `Intent.ACTION_VIEW`), you may
not get the result when you expect. For example, if the activity you
are launching uses `Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK`, it will not
run in your task and thus you will immediately receive a cancel result.

As a special case, if you call startActivityForResult() with a requestCode
>= 0 during the initial onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)/onResume() of your
activity, then your window will not be displayed until a result is
returned back from the started activity. This is to avoid visible
flickering when redirecting to another activity.

This method throws `ActivityNotFoundException`
if there was no Activity found to run the given Intent.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `intent` | `Intent`: The intent to start. |

| `requestCode` | `int`: If >= 0, this code will be returned in onActivityResult() when the activity exits; If < 0, no result will return when the activity exits. |

| `options` | `Bundle`: Additional options for how the Activity should be started. See `android.content.Context.startActivity(Intent,Bundle)` Context.startActivity(Intent, Bundle)} for more details.   This value may be `null`. |

| Throws | |
| --- | --- |
|  | android.content.ActivityNotFoundException |

```
public boolean startActivityIfNeeded (Intent intent, 
                int requestCode, 
                Bundle options)
```

A special variation to launch an activity only if a new activity
instance is needed to handle the given Intent. In other words, this is
just like `startActivityForResult(Intent,int)` except: if you are
using the `Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP` flag, or
singleTask or singleTop
`launchMode`,
and the activity
that handles intent is the same as your currently running
activity, then a new instance is not needed. In this case, instead of
the normal behavior of calling `onNewIntent(Intent)` this function will
return and you can handle the Intent yourself.

This function can only be called from a top-level activity; if it is
called from a child activity, a runtime exception will be thrown.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `intent` | `Intent`: The intent to start.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `requestCode` | `int`: If >= 0, this code will be returned in onActivityResult() when the activity exits; If < 0, no result will return when the activity exits, as described in `startActivityForResult(Intent, int)`. |
| `options` | `Bundle`: Additional options for how the Activity should be started. See `android.content.Context.startActivity(Intent,Bundle)` Context.startActivity(Intent, Bundle)} for more details.   This value may be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | If a new activity was launched then true is returned; otherwise false is returned and you must handle the Intent yourself. |

* `startActivity(Intent)`
* `startActivityForResult(Intent, int)`

```
public void startIntentSender (IntentSender intent, 
                Intent fillInIntent, 
                int flagsMask, 
                int flagsValues, 
                int extraFlags, 
                Bundle options)
```

Like `startActivity(Intent,Bundle)`, but taking a IntentSender
to start; see
`startIntentSenderForResult(IntentSender,int,Intent,int,int,int,Bundle)`
for more information.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `intent` | `IntentSender`: The IntentSender to launch. |
| `fillInIntent` | `Intent`: If non-null, this will be provided as the intent parameter to `IntentSender.sendIntent`. |
| `flagsMask` | `int`: Intent flags in the original IntentSender that you would like to change. |
| `flagsValues` | `int`: Desired values for any bits set in flagsMask |
| `extraFlags` | `int`: Always set to 0. |
| `options` | `Bundle`: Additional options for how the Activity should be started. See `android.content.Context.startActivity(Intent,Bundle)` Context.startActivity(Intent, Bundle)} for more details. If options have also been supplied by the IntentSender, options given here will override any that conflict with those given by the IntentSender.   This value may be `null`. |

| Throws | |
| --- | --- |
| `IntentSender.SendIntentException` |  |

### startIntentSenderForResult

Added in [API level 5](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `intent` | `IntentSender`: The IntentSender to launch. |
| `requestCode` | `int`: If >= 0, this code will be returned in onActivityResult() when the activity exits; If < 0, no result will return when the activity exits. |
| `fillInIntent` | `Intent`: If non-null, this will be provided as the intent parameter to `IntentSender.sendIntent`. |

                int extraFlags, 
                Bundle options)
```

Like `startActivityForResult(Intent,int)`, but allowing you
to use a IntentSender to describe the activity to be started. If
the IntentSender is for an activity, that activity will be started
as if you had called the regular `startActivityForResult(Intent,int)`
here; otherwise, its associated action will be executed (such as
sending a broadcast) as if you had called
`IntentSender.sendIntent` on it.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `intent` | `IntentSender`: The IntentSender to launch. |
| `requestCode` | `int`: If >= 0, this code will be returned in onActivityResult() when the activity exits; If < 0, no result will return when the activity exits. |
| `fillInIntent` | `Intent`: If non-null, this will be provided as the intent parameter to `IntentSender.sendIntent`. |

| Throws | |
| --- | --- |
| `IntentSender.SendIntentException` |  |

### startIntentSenderFromChild

Added in [API level 16](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in

Use
`startIntentSenderForResult(IntentSender,int,Intent,int,int,int,Bundle)`
instead.

Like `startActivityFromChild(Activity,Intent,int)`, but
taking a IntentSender; see
`startIntentSenderForResult(IntentSender,int,Intent,int,int,int)`
for more information.

| --- | --- |
| `child` | `Activity` |
| `intent` | `IntentSender` |

### startLocalVoiceInteraction

Added in [API level 24](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void startLocalVoiceInteraction (Bundle privateOptions)
```

Starts a local voice interaction session. When ready,
`onLocalVoiceInteractionStarted()` is called. You can pass a bundle of private options
to the registered voice interaction service.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `privateOptions` | `Bundle`: a Bundle of private arguments to the current voice interaction service |

### startLockTask

Added in [API level 21](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void startLockTask ()
```

Request to put this activity in a mode where the user is locked to a restricted set of
applications.

If `DevicePolicyManager.isLockTaskPermitted(String)` returns `true`
for this component, the current task will be launched directly into LockTask mode. Only apps
allowlisted by `DevicePolicyManager.setLockTaskPackages(ComponentName,String[])` can
be launched while LockTask mode is active. The user will not be able to leave this mode
until this activity calls `stopLockTask()`. Calling this method while the device is
already in LockTask mode has no effect.

Otherwise, the current task will be launched into screen pinning mode. In this case, the
system will prompt the user with a dialog requesting permission to use this mode.
The user can exit at any time through instructions shown on the request dialog. Calling
`stopLockTask()` will also terminate this mode.

**Note:** this method can only be called when the activity is foreground.
That is, between `onResume()` and `onPause()`.

**See also:**

* `stopLockTask()`
* `R.attr.lockTaskMode`

### startManagingCursor

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
15](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void startManagingCursor (Cursor c)
```

**This method was deprecated
in API level 15.**  
Use the new `CursorLoader` class with
`LoaderManager` instead; this is also
available on older platforms through the Android compatibility package.

This method allows the activity to take care of managing the given
`Cursor`'s lifecycle for you based on the activity's lifecycle.
That is, when the activity is stopped it will automatically call
`Cursor.deactivate` on the given Cursor, and when it is later restarted
it will call `Cursor.requery` for you. When the activity is
destroyed, all managed Cursors will be closed automatically.
*If you are targeting `Build.VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB`
or later, consider instead using `LoaderManager` instead, available
via `getLoaderManager()`.*

**Warning:** Do not call `Cursor.close()` on cursor obtained from
`managedQuery(Uri, String, String, String, String)`, because the activity will do that for you at the appropriate time.
However, if you call `stopManagingCursor(Cursor)` on a cursor from a managed query, the system
*will not* automatically close the cursor and, in that case, you must call
`Cursor.close()`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `c` | `Cursor`: The Cursor to be managed. |

**See also:**

* `managedQuery(android.net.Uri,String[],String,String[],String)`
* `stopManagingCursor(Cursor)`

### startNextMatchingActivity

Added in [API level 16](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean startNextMatchingActivity (Intent intent, 
                Bundle options)
```

Special version of starting an activity, for use when you are replacing
other activity components. You can use this to hand the Intent off
to the next Activity that can handle it. You typically call this in
`onCreate(Bundle)` with the Intent returned by `getIntent()`.
Note: For security reasons, the caller identity propagated to the next activity
will reflect this intermediary app's identity unless it shares the same UID
as the original caller. The receiving activity should validate the immediate
caller rather than assuming the original intent sender is preserved.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `intent` | `Intent`: The intent to dispatch to the next activity. For correct behavior, this must be the same as the Intent that started your own activity; the only changes you can make are to the extras inside of it.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `options` | `Bundle`: Additional options for how the Activity should be started. See `android.content.Context.startActivity(Intent,Bundle)` Context.startActivity(Intent, Bundle)} for more details.   This value may be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | Returns a boolean indicating whether there was another Activity to start: true if there was a next activity to start, false if there wasn't. In general, if true is returned you will then want to call finish() on yourself. |

### startNextMatchingActivity

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean startNextMatchingActivity (Intent intent)
```

Same as calling `startNextMatchingActivity(Intent,Bundle)` with
no options.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `intent` | `Intent`: The intent to dispatch to the next activity. For correct behavior, this must be the same as the Intent that started your own activity; the only changes you can make are to the extras inside of it.   This value cannot be `null`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | Returns a boolean indicating whether there was another Activity to start: true if there was a next activity to start, false if there wasn't. In general, if true is returned you will then want to call finish() on yourself. |

### startPostponedEnterTransition

Added in [API level 21](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void startPostponedEnterTransition ()
```

Begin postponed transitions after `postponeEnterTransition()` was called.
If postponeEnterTransition() was called, you must call startPostponedEnterTransition()
to have your Activity start drawing.

### startSearch

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void startSearch (String initialQuery, 
                boolean selectInitialQuery, 
                Bundle appSearchData, 
                boolean globalSearch)
```

This hook is called to launch the search UI.

It is typically called from onSearchRequested(), either directly from
Activity.onSearchRequested() or from an overridden version in any given
Activity. If your goal is simply to activate search, it is preferred to call
onSearchRequested(), which may have been overridden elsewhere in your Activity. If your goal
is to inject specific data such as context data, it is preferred to *override*
onSearchRequested(), so that any callers to it will benefit from the override.

Note: when running in a `Configuration.UI_MODE_TYPE_WATCH`, use of this API is
not supported.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `initialQuery` | `String`: Any non-null non-empty string will be inserted as pre-entered text in the search query box. |

| `selectInitialQuery` | `boolean`: If true, the initial query will be preselected, which means that any further typing will replace it. This is useful for cases where an entire pre-formed query is being inserted. If false, the selection point will be placed at the end of the inserted query. This is useful when the inserted query is text that the user entered, and the user would expect to be able to keep typing. *This parameter is only meaningful if initialQuery is a non-empty string.* |
| `appSearchData` | `Bundle`: An application can insert application-specific context here, in order to improve quality or specificity of its own searches. This data will be returned with SEARCH intent(s). Null if no extra data is required.   This value may be `null`. |
| `globalSearch` | `boolean`: If false, this will only launch the search that has been specifically defined by the application (which is usually defined as a local search). If no default search is defined in the current application or activity, global search will be launched. If true, this will always launch a platform-global (e.g. web-based) search instead. |

**See also:**

* `SearchManager`
* `onSearchRequested()`

### stopLocalVoiceInteraction

Added in [API level 24](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void stopLocalVoiceInteraction ()
```

Request to terminate the current voice interaction that was previously started
using `startLocalVoiceInteraction(Bundle)`. When the interaction is
terminated, `onLocalVoiceInteractionStopped()` will be called.

### stopLockTask

Added in [API level 21](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void stopLockTask ()
```

Stop the current task from being locked.

Called to end the LockTask or screen pinning mode started by `startLockTask()`.
This can only be called by activities that have called `startLockTask()` previously.

**Note:** If the device is in LockTask mode that is not initially started
by this activity, then calling this method will not terminate the LockTask mode, but only
finish its own task. The device will remain in LockTask mode, until the activity which
started the LockTask mode calls this method, or until its allowlist authorization is revoked
by `DevicePolicyManager.setLockTaskPackages(ComponentName,String[])`.

**See also:**

* `startLockTask()`
* `R.attr.lockTaskMode`
* `ActivityManager.getLockTaskModeState()`

### stopManagingCursor

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
15](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void stopManagingCursor (Cursor c)
```

**This method was deprecated
in API level 15.**  
Use the new `CursorLoader` class with
`LoaderManager` instead; this is also
available on older platforms through the Android compatibility package.

Given a Cursor that was previously given to
`startManagingCursor(Cursor)`, stop the activity's management of that
cursor.

**Warning:** After calling this method on a cursor from a managed query,
the system *will not* automatically close the cursor and you must call
`Cursor.close()`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `c` | `Cursor`: The Cursor that was being managed. |

**See also:**

* `startManagingCursor(Cursor)`

### takeKeyEvents

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void takeKeyEvents (boolean get)
```

Request that key events come to this activity. Use this if your
activity has no views with focus, but the activity still wants
a chance to process key events.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `get` | `boolean` |

**See also:**

* `Window.takeKeyEvents(boolean)`

### triggerSearch

Added in [API level 5](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void triggerSearch (String query, 
                Bundle appSearchData)
```

Similar to `startSearch(String, boolean, Bundle, boolean)`, but actually fires off the search query after invoking
the search dialog. Made available for testing purposes.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `query` | `String`: The query to trigger. If empty, the request will be ignored. |
| `appSearchData` | `Bundle`: An application can insert application-specific context here, in order to improve quality or specificity of its own searches. This data will be returned with SEARCH intent(s). Null if no extra data is required.   This value may be `null`. |

### unregisterActivityLifecycleCallbacks

Added in [API level 29](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void unregisterActivityLifecycleCallbacks (Application.ActivityLifecycleCallbacks callback)
```

Unregister an `Application.ActivityLifecycleCallbacks` previously registered
with `registerActivityLifecycleCallbacks(ActivityLifecycleCallbacks)`. It will not receive any further
callbacks.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `callback` | `Application.ActivityLifecycleCallbacks`: The callback instance to unregister.   This value cannot be `null`. |

**See also:**

* `registerActivityLifecycleCallbacks(ActivityLifecycleCallbacks)`

### unregisterComponentCallbacks

Added in [API level 14](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void unregisterComponentCallbacks (ComponentCallbacks callback)
```

Remove a `ComponentCallbacks` object that was previously registered
with `registerComponentCallbacks(ComponentCallbacks)`.

After `Build.VERSION_CODES.TIRAMISU`, the `ComponentCallbacks` will be
unregistered to `the base Context`, and can be only used after
`attachBaseContext(Context)`

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `callback` | `ComponentCallbacks`: The interface to call. This can be either a `ComponentCallbacks` or `ComponentCallbacks2` interface. |

### unregisterForContextMenu

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void unregisterForContextMenu (View view)

`OnCreateContextMenuListener` on the view.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `view` | `View`: The view that should stop showing a context menu. |

**See also:**

* `registerForContextMenu(View)`

### unregisterScreenCaptureCallback

## Protected methods

### attachBaseContext

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
protected void attachBaseContext (Context newBase)
```

Set the base context for this ContextWrapper. All calls will then be
delegated to the base context. Throws
IllegalStateException if a base context has already been set.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `newBase` | `Context`: The new base context for this wrapper. |

### onActivityResult

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
protected void onActivityResult (int requestCode, 
                int resultCode, 
                Intent data)
```

Called when an activity you launched exits, giving you the requestCode
you started it with, the resultCode it returned, and any additional
data from it. The resultCode will be
`RESULT_CANCELED` if the activity explicitly returned that,
didn't return any result, or crashed during its operation.

An activity can never receive a result in the resumed state. You can count on
`onResume()` being called after this method, though not necessarily immediately after.
If the activity was resumed, it will be paused and the result will be delivered, followed
by `onResume()`. If the activity wasn't in the resumed state, then the result will
be delivered, with `onResume()` called sometime later when the activity becomes active
again.

This method is never invoked if your activity sets
`noHistory` to
`true`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `requestCode` | `int`: The integer request code originally supplied to startActivityForResult(), allowing you to identify who this result came from. |

| `resultCode` | `int`: The integer result code returned by the child activity through its setResult(). |
| `data` | `Intent`: An Intent, which can return result data to the caller (various data can be attached to Intent "extras"). |

**See also:**

* `startActivityForResult(Intent, int)`
* `createPendingResult(int, Intent, int)`
* `setResult(int)`

### onApplyThemeResource

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
protected void onApplyThemeResource (Resources.Theme theme, 
                int resid, 
                boolean first)
```

Called by `setTheme(Theme)` and `getTheme()` to apply a theme
resource to the current Theme object. May be overridden to change the
default (simple) behavior. This method will not be called in multiple
threads simultaneously.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `theme` | `Resources.Theme`: the theme being modified |
| `resid` | `int`: the style resource being applied to theme |
| `first` | `boolean`: `true` if this is the first time a style is being applied to theme |

### onChildTitleChanged

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
protected void onChildTitleChanged (Activity childActivity, 
                CharSequence title)
```

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `childActivity` | `Activity` |
| `title` | `CharSequence` |

### onCreate

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
protected void onCreate (Bundle savedInstanceState)
```

Called when the activity is starting. This is where most initialization
should go: calling `setContentView(int)` to inflate the
activity's UI, using `findViewById(int)` to programmatically interact
with widgets in the UI, calling
`managedQuery(android.net.Uri,String[],String,String[],String)` to retrieve
cursors for data being displayed, etc.

You can call `finish()` from within this function, in
which case onDestroy() will be immediately called after `onCreate(Bundle)` without any of the
rest of the activity lifecycle (`onStart()`, `onResume()`, `onPause()`, etc.)
executing.

*Derived classes must call through to the super class's
implementation of this method. If they do not, an exception will be
thrown.*

.
  
This method must be called from the main thread of your app.
  
If you override this method you *must* call through to the
superclass implementation.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `savedInstanceState` | `Bundle`: If the activity is being re-initialized after previously being shut down then this Bundle contains the data it most recently supplied in `onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)`. ***Note: Otherwise it is null.*** |

**See also:**

* `onStart()`
* `onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)`
* `onRestoreInstanceState(Bundle)`
* `onPostCreate(Bundle)`

### onCreateDialog

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
15](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
protected Dialog onCreateDialog (int id)
```

**This method was deprecated
in API level 15.**  
Old no-arguments version of `onCreateDialog(int,Bundle)`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | `int` |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Dialog` |  |

### onCreateDialog

Added in [API level 8](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
15](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
protected Dialog onCreateDialog (int id, 
                Bundle args)
```

**This method was deprecated
in API level 15.**  
Use the new `DialogFragment` class with
`FragmentManager` instead; this is also
available on older platforms through the Android compatibility package.

Callback for creating dialogs that are managed (saved and restored) for you
by the activity. The default implementation calls through to
`onCreateDialog(int)` for compatibility.
*If you are targeting `Build.VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB`
or later, consider instead using a `DialogFragment` instead.*

If you use `showDialog(int)`, the activity will call through to
this method the first time, and hang onto it thereafter. Any dialog
that is created by this method will automatically be saved and restored
for you, including whether it is showing.

If you would like the activity to manage saving and restoring dialogs
for you, you should override this method and handle any ids that are
passed to `showDialog(int)`.

If you would like an opportunity to prepare your dialog before it is shown,
override `onPrepareDialog(int,Dialog,Bundle)`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | `int`: The id of the dialog. |

| `args` | `Bundle`: The dialog arguments provided to `showDialog(int,Bundle)`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `Dialog` | The dialog. If you return null, the dialog will not be created. |

**See also:**

* `onPrepareDialog(int,Dialog,Bundle)`
* `showDialog(int,Bundle)`
* `dismissDialog(int)`
* `removeDialog(int)`

### onDestroy

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
protected void onDestroy ()
```

Perform any final cleanup before an activity is destroyed. This can
happen either because the activity is finishing (someone called
`finish()` on it), or because the system is temporarily destroying
this instance of the activity to save space. You can distinguish
between these two scenarios with the `isFinishing()` method.

*Note: do not count on this method being called as a place for
saving data! For example, if an activity is editing data in a content
provider, those edits should be committed in either `onPause()` or
`onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)`, not here.* This method is usually implemented to
free resources like threads that are associated with an activity, so
that a destroyed activity does not leave such things around while the
rest of its application is still running. There are situations where
the system will simply kill the activity's hosting process without
calling this method (or any others) in it, so it should not be used to
do things that are intended to remain around after the process goes
away.

*Derived classes must call through to the super class's
implementation of this method. If they do not, an exception will be
thrown.*

If you override this method you *must* call through to the
superclass implementation.

### onNewIntent

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
protected void onNewIntent (Intent intent)
```

This is called for activities that set launchMode to "singleTop" in
their package, or if a client used the `Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP`
flag when calling `startActivity(Intent)`. In either case, when the
activity is re-launched while at the top of the activity stack instead
of a new instance of the activity being started, onNewIntent() will be
called on the existing instance with the Intent that was used to
re-launch it.

An activity can never receive a new intent in the resumed state. You can count on
`onResume()` being called after this method, though not necessarily immediately after
the completion of this callback. If the activity was resumed, it will be paused and new
intent will be delivered, followed by `onResume()`. If the activity wasn't in the
resumed state, then new intent can be delivered immediately, with `onResume()` called
sometime later when activity becomes active again.

Note that `getIntent()` still returns the original Intent. You
can use `setIntent(Intent)` to update it to this new Intent.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `intent` | `Intent`: The new intent that was used to start the activity |

**See also:**

* `getIntent()`
* `setIntent(Intent)`
* `onResume()`

### onPause

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
protected void onPause ()
```

Called as part of the activity lifecycle when the user no longer actively interacts with the
activity, but it is still visible on screen. The counterpart to `onResume()`.

When activity B is launched in front of activity A, this callback will
be invoked on A. B will not be created until A's `onPause()` returns,
so be sure to not do anything lengthy here.

This callback is mostly used for saving any persistent state the
activity is editing, to present a "edit in place" model to the user and
making sure nothing is lost if there are not enough resources to start
the new activity without first killing this one. This is also a good
place to stop things that consume a noticeable amount of CPU in order to
make the switch to the next activity as fast as possible.

On platform versions prior to `Build.VERSION_CODES.Q` this is also a good
place to try to close exclusive-access devices or to release access to singleton resources.
Starting with `Build.VERSION_CODES.Q` there can be multiple resumed
activities in the system at the same time, so `onTopResumedActivityChanged(boolean)`
should be used for that purpose instead.

If an activity is launched on top, after receiving this call you will usually receive a
following call to `onStop()` (after the next activity has been resumed and displayed
above). However in some cases there will be a direct call back to `onResume()` without
going through the stopped state. An activity can also rest in paused state in some cases when
in multi-window mode, still visible to user.

### onPostCreate

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
protected void onPostCreate (Bundle savedInstanceState)
```

Called when activity start-up is complete (after `onStart()`
and `onRestoreInstanceState(Bundle)` have been called). Applications will
generally not implement this method; it is intended for system
classes to do final initialization after application code has run.

*Derived classes must call through to the super class's
implementation of this method. If they do not, an exception will be
thrown.*

.
  
If you override this method you *must* call through to the
superclass implementation.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `savedInstanceState` | `Bundle`: If the activity is being re-initialized after previously being shut down then this Bundle contains the data it most recently supplied in `onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)`. ***Note: Otherwise it is null.*** |

**See also:**

* `onCreate(Bundle)`

### onPostResume

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
protected void onPostResume ()
```

Called when activity resume is complete (after `onResume()` has
been called). Applications will generally not implement this method;
it is intended for system classes to do final setup after application
resume code has run.

*Derived classes must call through to the super class's
implementation of this method. If they do not, an exception will be
thrown.*

### onPrepareDialog

Added in [API level 8](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
15](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
protected void onPrepareDialog (int id, 
                Dialog dialog, 
                Bundle args)
```

**This method was deprecated
in API level 15.**  
Use the new `DialogFragment` class with
`FragmentManager` instead; this is also
available on older platforms through the Android compatibility package.

Provides an opportunity to prepare a managed dialog before it is being
shown. The default implementation calls through to
`onPrepareDialog(int,Dialog)` for compatibility.

Override this if you need to update a managed dialog based on the state
of the application each time it is shown. For example, a time picker
dialog might want to be updated with the current time. You should call
through to the superclass's implementation. The default implementation
will set this Activity as the owner activity on the Dialog.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | `int`: The id of the managed dialog. |

| `dialog` | `Dialog`: The dialog. |
| `args` | `Bundle`: The dialog arguments provided to `showDialog(int,Bundle)`. |

**See also:**

* `onCreateDialog(int,Bundle)`
* `showDialog(int)`
* `dismissDialog(int)`

Deprecated in
[API level
15](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
protected void onPrepareDialog (int id, 
                Dialog dialog)
```

**This method was deprecated
in API level 15.**  
Old no-arguments version of
`onPrepareDialog(int,Dialog,Bundle)`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | `int` |
| `dialog` | `Dialog` |

### onRestart

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
protected void onRestart ()
```

Called after `onStop()` when the current activity is being
re-displayed to the user (the user has navigated back to it). It will
be followed by `onStart()` and then `onResume()`.

For activities that are using raw `Cursor` objects (instead of
creating them through
`managedQuery(android.net.Uri,String[],String,String[],String)`,
this is usually the place
where the cursor should be requeried (because you had deactivated it in
`onStop()`.

*Derived classes must call through to the super class's
implementation of this method. If they do not, an exception will be
thrown.*

.
  
If you override this method you *must* call through to the

* `onResume()`

### onRestoreInstanceState

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
protected void onRestoreInstanceState (Bundle savedInstanceState)
```

This method is called after `onStart()` when the activity is
being re-initialized from a previously saved state, given here in
savedInstanceState. Most implementations will simply use `onCreate(Bundle)`
to restore their state, but it is sometimes convenient to do it here
after all of the initialization has been done or to allow subclasses to
decide whether to use your default implementation. The default
implementation of this method performs a restore of any view state that
had previously been frozen by `onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)`.

This method is called between `onStart()` and
`onPostCreate(Bundle)`. This method is called only when recreating
an activity; the method isn't invoked if `onStart()` is called for
any other reason.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `savedInstanceState` | `Bundle`: the data most recently supplied in `onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)`.   This value cannot be `null`. |

**See also:**

* `onCreate(Bundle)`
* `onPostCreate(Bundle)`
* `onResume()`
* `onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)`

### onResume

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
protected void onResume ()
```

Called after `onRestoreInstanceState(Bundle)`, `onRestart()`, or `onPause()`. This
is usually a hint for your activity to start interacting with the user, which is a good
indicator that the activity became active and ready to receive input. This sometimes could
also be a transit state toward another resting state. For instance, an activity may be
relaunched to `onPause()` due to configuration changes and the activity was visible,
but wasn't the top-most activity of an activity task. `onResume()` is guaranteed to be
called before `onPause()` in this case which honors the activity lifecycle policy and
the activity eventually rests in `onPause()`.

On platform versions prior to `Build.VERSION_CODES.Q` this is also a good
place to try to open exclusive-access devices or to get access to singleton resources.
Starting with `Build.VERSION_CODES.Q` there can be multiple resumed
activities in the system simultaneously, so `onTopResumedActivityChanged(boolean)`
should be used for that purpose instead.

*Derived classes must call through to the super class's
implementation of this method. If they do not, an exception will be
thrown.*

.
  
If you override this method you *must* call through to the
superclass implementation.

### onSaveInstanceState

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
protected void onSaveInstanceState (Bundle outState)
```

Called to retrieve per-instance state from an activity before being killed
so that the state can be restored in `onCreate(Bundle)` or
`onRestoreInstanceState(Bundle)` (the `Bundle` populated by this method
will be passed to both).

This method is called before an activity may be killed so that when it
comes back some time in the future it can restore its state. For example,
if activity B is launched in front of activity A, and at some point activity
A is killed to reclaim resources, activity A will have a chance to save the
current state of its user interface via this method so that when the user
returns to activity A, the state of the user interface can be restored
via `onCreate(Bundle)` or `onRestoreInstanceState(Bundle)`.

Do not confuse this method with activity lifecycle callbacks such as `onPause()`,
which is always called when the user no longer actively interacts with an activity, or
`onStop()` which is called when activity becomes invisible. One example of when
`onPause()` and `onStop()` is called and not this method is when a user navigates
back from activity B to activity A: there is no need to call `onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)`
on B because that particular instance will never be restored,
so the system avoids calling it. An example when `onPause()` is called and
not `onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)` is when activity B is launched in front of activity A:
the system may avoid calling `onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)` on activity A if it isn't
killed during the lifetime of B since the state of the user interface of
A will stay intact.

The default implementation takes care of most of the UI per-instance
state for you by calling `View.onSaveInstanceState()` on each
view in the hierarchy that has an id, and by saving the id of the currently
focused view (all of which is restored by the default implementation of
`onRestoreInstanceState(Bundle)`). If you override this method to save additional
information not captured by each individual view, you will likely want to
call through to the default implementation, otherwise be prepared to save
all of the state of each view yourself.

If called, this method will occur after `onStop()` for applications
targeting platforms starting with `Build.VERSION_CODES.P`.
For applications targeting earlier platform versions this method will occur
before `onStop()` and there are no guarantees about whether it will
occur before or after `onPause()`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `outState` | `Bundle`: Bundle in which to place your saved state.   This value cannot be `null`. |

* `onCreate(Bundle)`
* `onRestoreInstanceState(Bundle)`
* `onPause()`

### onStart

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
protected void onStart ()
```

Called after `onCreate(Bundle)` — or after `onRestart()` when
the activity had been stopped, but is now again being displayed to the
user. It will usually be followed by `onResume()`. This is a good place to begin
drawing visual elements, running animations, etc.

You can call `finish()` from within this function, in
which case `onStop()` will be immediately called after `onStart()` without the
lifecycle transitions in-between (`onResume()`, `onPause()`, etc.) executing.

*Derived classes must call through to the super class's
implementation of this method. If they do not, an exception will be
thrown.*

### onStop

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
protected void onStop ()
```

Called when you are no longer visible to the user. You will next
receive either `onRestart()`, `onDestroy()`, or nothing,
depending on later user activity. This is a good place to stop
refreshing UI, running animations and other visual things.

*Derived classes must call through to the super class's
implementation of this method. If they do not, an exception will be
thrown.*

### onTitleChanged

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
protected void onTitleChanged (CharSequence title, 
                int color)
```

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `title` | `CharSequence` |
| `color` | `int` |

### onUserLeaveHint

Added in [API level 3](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
protected void onUserLeaveHint ()
```

Called as part of the activity lifecycle when an activity is about to go
into the background as the result of user choice. For example, when the
user presses the Home key, `onUserLeaveHint()` will be called, but
when an incoming phone call causes the in-call Activity to be automatically
brought to the foreground, `onUserLeaveHint()` will not be called on
the activity being interrupted. In cases when it is invoked, this method
is called right before the activity's `onPause()` callback.

This callback and `onUserInteraction()` are intended to help
activities manage status bar notifications intelligently; specifically,
for helping activities determine the proper time to cancel a notification.

* `onUserInteraction()`
* `Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_USER_ACTION`
