| ↳ | android.app.NotificationManager |

  

---

Class to notify the user of events that happen. This is how you tell
the user that something has happened in the background.

Notifications can take different forms:

* A persistent icon that goes in the status bar and is accessible
  through the launcher, (when the user selects it, a designated Intent
  can be launched),
* Turning on or flashing LEDs on the device, or
* Alerting the user by flashing the backlight, playing a sound,
  or vibrating.

Each of the notify methods takes an int id parameter and optionally a
`String` tag parameter, which may be `null`. These parameters
are used to form a pair (tag, id), or (`null`, id) if tag is
unspecified. This pair identifies this notification from your app to the
system, so that pair should be unique within your app. If you call one
of the notify methods with a (tag, id) pair that is currently active and
a new set of notification parameters, it will be updated. For example,
if you pass a new status bar icon, the old icon in the status bar will
be replaced with the new one. This is also the same tag and id you pass
to the `cancel(int)` or `cancel(String,int)` method to clear
this notification.

## Constants

### ACTION\_APP\_BLOCK\_STATE\_CHANGED

Added in [API level 28](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String ACTION_APP_BLOCK_STATE_CHANGED
```

Intent that is broadcast when an application is blocked or unblocked.
This broadcast is only sent to the app whose block state has changed.
Input: nothing
Output: `EXTRA_BLOCKED_STATE`

Constant Value:
"android.app.action.APP\_BLOCK\_STATE\_CHANGED"

### ACTION\_AUTOMATIC\_ZEN\_RULE

Added in [API level 29](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String ACTION_AUTOMATIC_ZEN_RULE
```

Activity Action: Launch an Automatic Zen Rule configuration screen

Input: Optionally, `EXTRA_AUTOMATIC_RULE_ID`, if the configuration screen for an
existing rule should be displayed. If the rule id is missing or null, apps should display
a configuration screen where users can create a new instance of the rule.

Output: Nothing

You can have multiple activities handling this intent, if you support multiple
`rules`. In order for the system to properly display all of your
rule types so that users can create new instances or configure existing ones, you need
to add some extra metadata (`META_DATA_AUTOMATIC_RULE_TYPE`)
to your activity tag in your manifest. If you'd like to limit the number of rules a user
can create from this flow, you can additionally optionally include
`META_DATA_RULE_INSTANCE_LIMIT`. For example,

```
    <meta-data
        android:name="android.service.zen.automatic.ruleType"
        android:value="@string/my_condition_rule" />
    <meta-data
        android:name="android.service.zen.automatic.ruleInstanceLimit"

### EXTRA\_NOTIFICATION\_POLICY

Added in [API level 35](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final String EXTRA_NOTIFICATION_POLICY
```

Extra for `ACTION_NOTIFICATION_POLICY_CHANGED` and

### createNotificationChannel

Added in [API level 26](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void createNotificationChannel (NotificationChannel channel)
```

Creates a notification channel that notifications can be posted to.
This can also be used to restore a deleted channel and to update an existing channel's
name, description, group, and/or importance.

The name and description should only be changed if the locale changes
or in response to the user renaming this channel. For example, if a user has a channel
named 'Messages' and the user changes their locale, this channel's name should be updated
with the translation of 'Messages' in the new locale.

The importance of an existing channel will only be changed if the new importance is lower
than the current value and the user has not altered any settings on this channel.

The group an existing channel will only be changed if the channel does not already
belong to a group.
All other fields are ignored for channels that already exist.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `channel` | `NotificationChannel`: the channel to create. Note that the created channel may differ from this value. If the provided channel is malformed, a RemoteException will be thrown.   This value cannot be `null`. |

Group information is only used for presentation, not for behavior. Groups are optional
for channels, and you can have a mix of channels that belong to groups and channels
that do not.

For example, if your application supports multiple accounts, and those accounts will
have similar channels, you can create a group for each account with account specific
labels instead of appending account information to each channel's label.

| --- | --- |
| `boolean` |  |

### matchesCallFilter

Added in [API level 33](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean matchesCallFilter (Uri uri)
```

Returns whether a call from the provided URI is permitted to notify the user.

A true return value indicates one of the following: Do Not Disturb is not currently active;
or the caller is a repeat caller and the current policy allows interruptions from repeat
callers; or the caller is in the user's set of contacts whose calls are allowed to interrupt
Do Not Disturb.

If Do Not Disturb is enabled and either no interruptions or only alarms are allowed, this
method will return false regardless of input.

The provided URI should be a `tel:` or `mailto:` schema URI indicating
the source of the call. For an accurate answer regarding whether the caller matches the
user's permitted contacts, the path part of the URI must match an entry the Contacts database
in the appropriate column.

Passing in a `ContactsContract.Contacts.CONTENT_LOOKUP_URI` is also
permissible, but should only be used for priority contact interruptions and may not provide
accurate results in the case of repeat callers.

See also `Person.Builder.setUri` and
`ContactsContract.Contacts.CONTENT_LOOKUP_URI`
for more information.

Callers of this method must have notification listener access, permission to read contacts,
or have system permissions.

NOTE: This method calls into Contacts, which may take some time, and should not be called
on the main thread.

.
  
This method may take several seconds to complete, so it should
only be called from a worker thread.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `uri` | `Uri`: A URI representing a caller. Must not be null. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | A boolean indicating whether a call from the URI provided would be allowed to interrupt the user given the current filter. |

```
public void notify (int id, 
                Notification notification)
```

Post a notification to be shown in the status bar. If a notification with
the same id has already been posted by your application and has not yet been canceled, it
will be replaced by the updated information.

                int id, 
                Notification notification)
```

Posts a notification as a specified package to be shown in the status bar. If a notification
with the same tag and id has already been posted for that package and has not yet been
canceled, it will be replaced by the updated information.
All `listener services` will
be granted `Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION` access to any `uris`
provided on this notification or the
`NotificationChannel` this notification is posted to using
`Context.grantUriPermission(String,Uri,int)`. Permission will be revoked when the
notification is canceled, or you can revoke permissions with
`Context.revokeUriPermission(Uri,int)`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `targetPackage` | `String`: The package to post the notification as. The package must have granted you access to post notifications on their behalf with `setNotificationDelegate(String)`.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `tag` | `String`: A string identifier for this notification. May be `null`. |
| `id` | `int`: An identifier for this notification. The pair (tag, id) must be unique within your application. |
| `notification` | `Notification`: A `Notification` object describing what to show the user. Must not be null. |

### removeAutomaticZenRule

Added in [API level 24](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean removeAutomaticZenRule (String id)
```

Deletes the automatic zen rule with the given id.

Throws a SecurityException if policy access is not granted to this package.
See `isNotificationPolicyAccessGranted()`.

Callers can only delete rules that they own. See `AutomaticZenRule.getOwner`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | `String`: the id of the rule to delete. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | Whether the rule was successfully deleted. |

### setAutomaticZenRuleState

Added in [API level 29](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void setAutomaticZenRuleState (String id, 
                Condition condition)
```

Informs the notification manager that the state of an `AutomaticZenRule` has changed.
Use this method to put the system into Do Not Disturb mode or request that it exits Do Not
Disturb mode. The calling app must own the provided `AutomaticZenRule`.

This method can be used in conjunction with or as a replacement to
`android.service.notification.ConditionProviderService.notifyCondition(Condition)`.

The condition change may be ignored if the user has activated or deactivated the rule
manually -- the user can "override" the rule *this time*, with the rule resuming its
normal operation for the next cycle. When this has happened, the supplied condition will be
applied only once the automatic state is in agreement with the user-provided state. For
example, assume that the `AutomaticZenRule` corresponds to a "Driving Mode" with
automatic driving detection.

1. App detects driving and notifies the system that the rule should be active, calling
   this method with a `Condition` with `Condition.STATE_TRUE`).
2. User deactivates ("snoozes") the rule for some reason. This overrides the
   app-provided condition state.
3. App is still detecting driving, so again calls with `Condition.STATE_TRUE`.
   This is ignored by the system, as the user override prevails.
4. Some time later, the app detects that driving stopped, so the rule should be
   inactive, and calls with `Condition.STATE_FALSE`). This doesn't change the actual
   rule state (it was already inactive due to the user's override), but clears the override.
5. Some time later, the app detects that driving has started again, and notifies that
   the rule should be active (calling with `Condition.STATE_TRUE` again). The rule is
   activated.

Note that the behavior at step #3 is different if the app also specifies
`Condition.SOURCE_USER_ACTION` as the `Condition.source` -- rule state updates
coming from user actions are not ignored.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | `String`: The id of the rule whose state should change.   This value cannot be `null`. |
| `condition` | `Condition`: The new state of this rule.   This value cannot be `null`. |

### setInterruptionFilter

Added in [API level 23](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public final void setInterruptionFilter (int interruptionFilter)
```

Sets the current notification interruption filter.

The interruption filter defines which notifications are allowed to
interrupt the user (e.g. via sound & vibration) and is applied
globally.

Apps targeting `Build.VERSION_CODES.VANILLA_ICE_CREAM` and above (with some
exceptions, such as companion device managers) cannot modify the global interruption filter.
Calling this method will instead activate or deactivate an `AutomaticZenRule`
associated to the app, using a `ZenPolicy` that corresponds to the `Policy`
supplied to `setNotificationPolicy(Policy)` (or the global policy when one wasn't
provided).

Only available if policy access is granted to this package. See
`isNotificationPolicyAccessGranted()`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `interruptionFilter` | `int`: Value is one of the following:  * `INTERRUPTION_FILTER_NONE` * `INTERRUPTION_FILTER_PRIORITY` * `INTERRUPTION_FILTER_ALARMS` * `INTERRUPTION_FILTER_ALL` * `INTERRUPTION_FILTER_UNKNOWN` |

### setNotificationDelegate

Added in [API level 29](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void setNotificationDelegate (String delegate)
```

Allows a package to post notifications on your behalf using
`notifyAsPackage(String,String,int,Notification)`.
This can be used to allow persistent processes to post notifications based on messages
received on your behalf from the cloud, without your process having to wake up.
You can check if you have an allowed delegate with `getNotificationDelegate()` and
revoke your delegate by passing null to this method.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `delegate` | `String`: Package name of the app which can send notifications on your behalf.   This value may be `null`. |

### setNotificationPolicy

Added in [API level 23](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void setNotificationPolicy (NotificationManager.Policy policy)
```

Sets the current notification policy (which applies when `setInterruptionFilter(int)` is
called with the `INTERRUPTION_FILTER_PRIORITY` value).

Apps targeting `Build.VERSION_CODES.VANILLA_ICE_CREAM` and above (with some
exceptions, such as companion device managers) cannot modify the global notification policy.
Calling this method will instead create or update an `AutomaticZenRule` associated to
the app, using a `ZenPolicy` corresponding to the `Policy` supplied here, and
which will be activated/deactivated by calls to `setInterruptionFilter(int)`.

Only available if policy access is granted to this package. See
`isNotificationPolicyAccessGranted()`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `policy` | `NotificationManager.Policy`: The new desired policy.   This value cannot be `null`. |

### shouldHideSilentStatusBarIcons

Added in [API level 29](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean shouldHideSilentStatusBarIcons ()
```

Returns whether the user wants silent notifications (see `IMPORTANCE_LOW` to appear
in the status bar.

Only available for `notification
listeners`.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` |  |

### updateAutomaticZenRule

Added in [API level 24](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean updateAutomaticZenRule (String id, 
                AutomaticZenRule automaticZenRule)
```

Updates the given zen rule.

Before `Build.VERSION_CODES.VANILLA_ICE_CREAM`, updating a rule that is not backed
up by a `ConditionProviderService` will deactivate it if
it was previously active. Starting with `Build.VERSION_CODES.VANILLA_ICE_CREAM`, this
will only happen if the rule's definition is actually changing.

Throws a SecurityException if policy access is not granted to this package.
See `isNotificationPolicyAccessGranted()`.

Callers can only update rules that they own. See `AutomaticZenRule.getOwner`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | `String`: The id of the rule to update |
| `automaticZenRule` | `AutomaticZenRule`: the rule to update. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | Whether the rule was successfully updated. |
