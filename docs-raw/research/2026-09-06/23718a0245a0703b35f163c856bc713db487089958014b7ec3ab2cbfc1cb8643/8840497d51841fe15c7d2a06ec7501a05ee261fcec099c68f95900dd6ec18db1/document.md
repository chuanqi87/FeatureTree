A Service is an application component representing either an application's desire
to perform a longer-running operation while not interacting with the user
or to supply functionality for other applications to use. Each service
class must have a corresponding
`<service>`
declaration in its package's `AndroidManifest.xml`. Services
can be started with
`Context.startService()` and
`Context.bindService()`.

Note that services, like other application objects, run in the main
thread of their hosting process. This means that, if your service is going
to do any CPU intensive (such as MP3 playback) or blocking (such as
networking) operations, it should spawn its own thread in which to do that
work. More information on this can be found in
[Processes and
Threads](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/fundamentals/processes-and-threads). The `JobIntentService` class is available
as a standard implementation of Service that has its own thread where it
schedules its work to be done.

### Developer Guides

For a detailed discussion about how to create services, read the
[Services](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/fundamentals/services) developer guide.



### What is a Service?

Most confusion about the Service class actually revolves around what
it is *not*:

* A Service is **not** a separate process. The Service object itself
  does not imply it is running in its own process; unless otherwise specified,
  it runs in the same process as the application it is part of.
* A Service is **not** a thread. It is not a means itself to do work off
  of the main thread (to avoid Application Not Responding errors).

Thus a Service itself is actually very simple, providing two main features:

* A facility for the application to tell the system *about*
  something it wants to be doing in the background (even when the user is not
  directly interacting with the application). This corresponds to calls to
  `Context.startService()`, which
  ask the system to schedule work for the service, to be run until the service
  or someone else explicitly stop it.
* A facility for an application to expose some of its functionality to
  other applications. This corresponds to calls to
  `Context.bindService()`, which
  allows a long-standing connection to be made to the service in order to
  interact with it.

When a Service component is actually created, for either of these reasons,
all that the system actually does is instantiate the component
and call its `onCreate()` and any other appropriate callbacks on the
main thread. It is up to the Service to implement these with the appropriate
behavior, such as creating a secondary thread in which it does its work.

Note that because Service itself is so simple, you can make your
interaction with it as simple or complicated as you want: from treating it
as a local Java object that you make direct method calls on (as illustrated
by [Local Service Sample](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service#LocalServiceSample)), to providing
a full remoteable interface using AIDL.



### Service Lifecycle

There are two reasons that a service can be run by the system. If someone
calls `Context.startService()` then the system will
retrieve the service (creating it and calling its `onCreate()` method
if needed) and then call its `onStartCommand(Intent, int, int)` method with the
arguments supplied by the client. The service will at this point continue
running until `Context.stopService()` or
`stopSelf()` is called. Note that multiple calls to
Context.startService() do not nest (though they do result in multiple corresponding
calls to onStartCommand()), so no matter how many times it is started a service
will be stopped once Context.stopService() or stopSelf() is called; however,
services can use their `stopSelf(int)` method to ensure the service is
not stopped until started intents have been processed.

For started services, there are two additional major modes of operation
they can decide to run in, depending on the value they return from
onStartCommand(): `START_STICKY` is used for services that are
explicitly started and stopped as needed, while `START_NOT_STICKY`
or `START_REDELIVER_INTENT` are used for services that should only
remain running while processing any commands sent to them. See the linked
documentation for more detail on the semantics.

Clients can also use `Context.bindService()` to
obtain a persistent connection to a service. This likewise creates the
service if it is not already running (calling `onCreate()` while
doing so), but does not call onStartCommand(). The client will receive the
`IBinder` object that the service returns from its
`onBind(Intent)` method, allowing the client to then make calls back
to the service. The service will remain running as long as the connection
is established (whether or not the client retains a reference on the
service's IBinder). Usually the IBinder returned is for a complex
interface that has been [written
in aidl](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/aidl).

A service can be both started and have connections bound to it. In such
a case, the system will keep the service running as long as either it is
started *or* there are one or more connections to it with the
`Context.BIND_AUTO_CREATE`
flag. Once neither
of these situations hold, the service's `onDestroy()` method is called
and the service is effectively terminated. All cleanup (stopping threads,
unregistering receivers) should be complete upon returning from onDestroy().

### Permissions

Global access to a service can be enforced when it is declared in its
manifest's `<service>`
tag. By doing so, other applications will need to declare a corresponding
`<uses-permission>`
element in their own manifest to be able to start, stop, or bind to
the service.

As of `Build.VERSION_CODES.GINGERBREAD`, when using
`Context.startService(Intent)`, you can
also set `Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION` and/or `Intent.FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION` on the Intent. This will grant the
Service temporary access to the specific URIs in the Intent. Access will
remain until the Service has called `stopSelf(int)` for that start
command or a later one, or until the Service has been completely stopped.
This works for granting access to the other apps that have not requested
the permission protecting the Service, or even when the Service is not
exported at all.

In addition, a service can protect individual IPC calls into it with
permissions, by calling the
`ContextWrapper.checkCallingPermission(String)`
method before executing the implementation of that call.

See the [Security and Permissions](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/security/security)
document for more information on permissions and security in general.

### Process Lifecycle

The Android system will attempt to keep the process hosting a service
around as long as the service has been started or has clients bound to it.
When running low on memory and needing to kill existing processes, the
priority of a process hosting the service will be the higher of the
following possibilities:

* If the service is currently executing code in its
  `onCreate()`, `onStartCommand()`,
  or `onDestroy()` methods, then the hosting process will
  be a foreground process to ensure this code can execute without
  being killed.
* If the service has been started, then its hosting process is considered
  to be less important than any processes that are currently visible to the
  user on-screen, but more important than any process not visible. Because
  only a few processes are generally visible to the user, this means that
  the service should not be killed except in low memory conditions. However, since
  the user is not directly aware of a background service, in that state it *is*
  considered a valid candidate to kill, and you should be prepared for this to
  happen. In particular, long-running services will be increasingly likely to
  kill and are guaranteed to be killed (and restarted if appropriate) if they
  remain started long enough.
* If there are clients bound to the service, then the service's hosting
  process is never less important than the most important client. That is,
  if one of its clients is visible to the user, then the service itself is
  considered to be visible. The way a client's importance impacts the service's
  importance can be adjusted through `Context.BIND_ABOVE_CLIENT`,
  `Context.BIND_ALLOW_OOM_MANAGEMENT`, `Context.BIND_WAIVE_PRIORITY`,
  `Context.BIND_IMPORTANT`, and `Context.BIND_ADJUST_WITH_ACTIVITY`.
* A started service can use the `startForeground(int,Notification)`
  API to put the service in a foreground state, where the system considers
  it to be something the user is actively aware of and thus not a candidate
  for killing when low on memory. (It is still theoretically possible for
  the service to be killed under extreme memory pressure from the current
  foreground application, but in practice this should not be a concern.)

Note this means that most of the time your service is running, it may
be killed by the system if it is under heavy memory pressure. If this
happens, the system will later try to restart the service. An important
consequence of this is that if you implement `onStartCommand()`
to schedule work to be done asynchronously or in another thread, then you
may want to use `START_FLAG_REDELIVERY` to have the system
re-deliver an Intent for you so that it does not get lost if your service
is killed while processing it.

Other application components running in the same process as the service
(such as an `Activity`) can, of course, increase the
importance of the overall
process beyond just the importance of the service itself.

### Local Service Sample

One of the most common uses of a Service is as a secondary component
running alongside other parts of an application, in the same process as
the rest of the components. All components of an .apk run in the same
process unless explicitly stated otherwise, so this is a typical situation.

When used in this way, by assuming the
components are in the same process, you can greatly simplify the interaction
between them: clients of the service can simply cast the IBinder they
receive from it to a concrete class published by the service.

An example of this use of a Service is shown here. First is the Service
itself, publishing a custom class when bound:

```
public class LocalService extends Service {
    private NotificationManager mNM;

    // Unique Identification Number for the Notification.
    // We use it on Notification start, and to cancel it.
    private int NOTIFICATION = R.string.local_service_started;

    /**
     * Class for clients to access.  Because we know this service always
     * runs in the same process as its clients, we don't need to deal with
     * IPC.
     */
    public class LocalBinder extends Binder {
        LocalService getService() {
            return LocalService.this;
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        mNM = (NotificationManager)getSystemService(NOTIFICATION_SERVICE);

        // Display a notification about us starting.  We put an icon in the status bar.
        showNotification();
    }

    @Override
    public int onStartCommand(Intent intent, int flags, int startId) {
        Log.i("LocalService", "Received start id " + startId + ": " + intent);
        return START_NOT_STICKY;
    }

    @Override
    public void onDestroy() {
        // Cancel the persistent notification.
        mNM.cancel(NOTIFICATION);

        // Tell the user we stopped.
        Toast.makeText(this, R.string.local_service_stopped, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }

    @Override
    public IBinder onBind(Intent intent) {
        return mBinder;
    }

    // This is the object that receives interactions from clients.  See
    // RemoteService for a more complete example.
    private final IBinder mBinder = new LocalBinder();

    /**
     * Show a notification while this service is running.
     */
    private void showNotification() {
        // In this sample, we'll use the same text for the ticker and the expanded notification
        CharSequence text = getText(R.string.local_service_started);

        // The PendingIntent to launch our activity if the user selects this notification
        PendingIntent contentIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0,
                new Intent(this, LocalServiceActivities.Controller.class), 0);

        // Set the info for the views that show in the notification panel.
        Notification notification = new Notification.Builder(this)
                .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.stat_sample)  // the status icon
                .setTicker(text)  // the status text
                .setWhen(System.currentTimeMillis())  // the time stamp
                .setContentTitle(getText(R.string.local_service_label))  // the label of the entry
                .setContentText(text)  // the contents of the entry
                .setContentIntent(contentIntent)  // The intent to send when the entry is clicked
                .build();

        // Send the notification.
        mNM.notify(NOTIFICATION, notification);
    }
}
```

With that done, one can now write client code that directly accesses the
running service, such as:

```
/**
 * Example of binding and unbinding to the local service.

### Remote Messenger Service Sample

If you need to be able to write a Service that can perform complicated
communication with clients in remote processes (beyond simply the use of
`Context.startService` to send
commands to it), then you can use the `Messenger` class
instead of writing full AIDL files.

An example of a Service that uses Messenger as its client interface
is shown here. First is the Service itself, publishing a Messenger to
an internal Handler when bound:

```
public class MessengerService extends Service {
    /** For showing and hiding our notification. */
    NotificationManager mNM;
    /** Keeps track of all current registered clients. */
    ArrayList<Messenger> mClients = new ArrayList<Messenger>();
    /** Holds last value set by a client. */
    int mValue = 0;

    /**
     * Command to the service to register a client, receiving callbacks
     * from the service.  The Message's replyTo field must be a Messenger of
     * the client where callbacks should be sent.
     */
    static final int MSG_REGISTER_CLIENT = 1;

    /**
     * Command to the service to unregister a client, ot stop receiving callbacks
     * from the service.  The Message's replyTo field must be a Messenger of
     * the client as previously given with MSG_REGISTER_CLIENT.
     */
    static final int MSG_UNREGISTER_CLIENT = 2;

    /**
     * Command to service to set a new value.  This can be sent to the
     * service to supply a new value, and will be sent by the service to
     * any registered clients with the new value.
     */
    static final int MSG_SET_VALUE = 3;

    /**
     * Handler of incoming messages from clients.
     */
    class IncomingHandler extends Handler {
        @Override
        public void handleMessage(Message msg) {
            switch (msg.what) {
                case MSG_REGISTER_CLIENT:
                    mClients.add(msg.replyTo);
                    break;
                case MSG_UNREGISTER_CLIENT:
                    mClients.remove(msg.replyTo);
                    break;
                case MSG_SET_VALUE:
                    mValue = msg.arg1;
                    for (int i=mClients.size()-1; i>=0; i--) {
                        try {
                            mClients.get(i).send(Message.obtain(null,
                                    MSG_SET_VALUE, mValue, 0));
                        } catch (RemoteException e) {
                            // The client is dead.  Remove it from the list;
                            // we are going through the list from back to front
                            // so this is safe to do inside the loop.
                            mClients.remove(i);
                        }
                    }
                    break;
                default:
                    super.handleMessage(msg);
            }
        }
    }

    /**
     * Target we publish for clients to send messages to IncomingHandler.
     */
    final Messenger mMessenger = new Messenger(new IncomingHandler());

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        mNM = (NotificationManager)getSystemService(NOTIFICATION_SERVICE);

        // Display a notification about us starting.
        showNotification();
    }

    @Override
    public void onDestroy() {
        // Cancel the persistent notification.
        mNM.cancel(R.string.remote_service_started);

        // Tell the user we stopped.
        Toast.makeText(this, R.string.remote_service_stopped, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }

    /**
     * When binding to the service, we return an interface to our messenger
     * for sending messages to the service.
     */
    @Override
    public IBinder onBind(Intent intent) {
        return mMessenger.getBinder();
    }

    /**
     * Show a notification while this service is running.
     */
    private void showNotification() {
        // In this sample, we'll use the same text for the ticker and the expanded notification
        CharSequence text = getText(R.string.remote_service_started);

        // The PendingIntent to launch our activity if the user selects this notification
        PendingIntent contentIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0,
                new Intent(this, Controller.class), 0);

        // Set the info for the views that show in the notification panel.
        Notification notification = new Notification.Builder(this)
                .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.stat_sample)  // the status icon
                .setTicker(text)  // the status text
                .setWhen(System.currentTimeMillis())  // the time stamp
                .setContentTitle(getText(R.string.local_service_label))  // the label of the entry
                .setContentText(text)  // the contents of the entry
                .setContentIntent(contentIntent)  // The intent to send when the entry is clicked
                .build();

        // Send the notification.
        // We use a string id because it is a unique number.  We use it later to cancel.
        mNM.notify(R.string.remote_service_started, notification);
    }
}
```

If we want to make this service run in a remote process (instead of the
standard one for its .apk), we can use `android:process` in its
manifest tag to specify one:

```
<service android:name=".app.MessengerService"
        android:process=":remote" />
```

Note that the name "remote" chosen here is arbitrary, and you can use
other names if you want additional processes. The ':' prefix appends the
name to your package's standard process name.

With that done, clients can now bind to the service and send messages
to it. Note that this allows clients to register with it to receive
messages back as well:

```
/**
 * Example of binding and unbinding to the remote service.
 * This demonstrates the implementation of a service which the client will
 * bind to, interacting with it through an aidl interface.
 * 
 * Note that this is implemented as an inner class only keep the sample
 * all together; typically this code would appear in some separate class.

## Summary



| Constants | |
| --- | --- |
| `int` | `START_CONTINUATION_MASK` Bits returned by `onStartCommand(Intent, int, int)` describing how to continue the service if it is killed. |
| `int` | `START_FLAG_REDELIVERY` This flag is set in `onStartCommand(Intent, int, int)` if the Intent is a re-delivery of a previously delivered intent, because the service had previously returned `START_REDELIVER_INTENT` but had been killed before calling `stopSelf(int)` for that Intent. |
| `int` | `START_FLAG_RETRY` This flag is set in `onStartCommand(Intent, int, int)` if the Intent is a retry because the original attempt never got to or returned from `onStartCommand(Intent,int,int)`. |
| `int` | `START_NOT_STICKY` Constant to return from `onStartCommand(Intent, int, int)`: if this service's process is killed while it is started (after returning from `onStartCommand(Intent, int, int)`), and there are no new start intents to deliver to it, then take the service out of the started state and don't recreate until a future explicit call to `Context.startService(Intent)`. |
| `int` | `START_REDELIVER_INTENT` Constant to return from `onStartCommand(Intent, int, int)`: if this service's process is killed while it is started (after returning from `onStartCommand(Intent, int, int)`), then it will be scheduled for a restart and the last delivered Intent re-delivered to it again via `onStartCommand(Intent, int, int)`. |
| `int` | `START_STICKY` Constant to return from `onStartCommand(Intent, int, int)`: if this service's process is killed while it is started (after returning from `onStartCommand(Intent, int, int)`), then leave it in the started state but don't retain this delivered intent. |
| `int` | `START_STICKY_COMPATIBILITY` Constant to return from `onStartCommand(Intent, int, int)`: compatibility version of `START_STICKY` that does not guarantee that `onStartCommand(Intent, int, int)` will be called again after being killed. |
| `int` | `STOP_FOREGROUND_DETACH` Selector for `stopForeground(int)`: if set, the notification previously supplied to `startForeground(int, Notification)` will be detached from the service's lifecycle. |
| `int` | `STOP_FOREGROUND_LEGACY` *This constant was deprecated in API level 33. Use `STOP_FOREGROUND_DETACH` instead. The legacy behavior was inconsistent, leading to bugs around unpredictable results.* |
| `int` | `STOP_FOREGROUND_REMOVE` Selector for `stopForeground(int)`: if supplied, the notification previously supplied to `startForeground(int, Notification)` will be cancelled and removed from display. |

`BIND_INCLUDE_CAPABILITIES` Flag for `bindService(Intent, BindServiceFlags, Executor, ServiceConnection)`: If binding from an app that has specific capabilities due to its foreground state such as an activity or foreground service, then this flag will allow the bound app to get the same capabilities, as long as it has the required permissions as well. | | `int` | `BIND_NOT_FOREGROUND` Flag for `bindService(Intent, BindServiceFlags, Executor, ServiceConnection)`: don't allow this binding to raise the target service's process to the foreground scheduling priority. | | `int` |

## Constants

### START\_CONTINUATION\_MASK

Added in [API level 5](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int START_CONTINUATION_MASK
```

Bits returned by `onStartCommand(Intent, int, int)` describing how to continue
the service if it is killed. May be `START_STICKY`,
`START_NOT_STICKY`, `START_REDELIVER_INTENT`,
or `START_STICKY_COMPATIBILITY`.

Constant Value:
15
(0x0000000f)

### START\_FLAG\_REDELIVERY

Added in [API level 5](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int START_FLAG_REDELIVERY
```

This flag is set in `onStartCommand(Intent, int, int)` if the Intent is a
re-delivery of a previously delivered intent, because the service
had previously returned `START_REDELIVER_INTENT` but had been
killed before calling `stopSelf(int)` for that Intent.

Constant Value:
1
(0x00000001)

### START\_FLAG\_RETRY

Added in [API level 5](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int START_FLAG_RETRY
```

This flag is set in `onStartCommand(Intent, int, int)` if the Intent is a
retry because the original attempt never got to or returned from
`onStartCommand(Intent,int,int)`.

Constant Value:
2
(0x00000002)

### START\_NOT\_STICKY

Added in [API level 5](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int START_NOT_STICKY
```

Constant to return from `onStartCommand(Intent, int, int)`: if this service's
process is killed while it is started (after returning from
`onStartCommand(Intent, int, int)`), and there are no new start intents to
deliver to it, then take the service out of the started state and
don't recreate until a future explicit call to
`Context.startService(Intent)`. The
service will not receive a `onStartCommand(Intent,int,int)`
call with a null Intent because it will not be restarted if there
are no pending Intents to deliver.

This mode makes sense for things that want to do some work as a
result of being started, but can be stopped when under memory pressure
and will explicit start themselves again later to do more work. An
example of such a service would be one that polls for data from
a server: it could schedule an alarm to poll every N minutes by having
the alarm start its service. When its `onStartCommand(Intent, int, int)` is
called from the alarm, it schedules a new alarm for N minutes later,
and spawns a thread to do its networking. If its process is killed
while doing that check, the service will not be restarted until the
alarm goes off.

Constant Value:
2
(0x00000002)

### START\_REDELIVER\_INTENT

Added in [API level 5](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int START_REDELIVER_INTENT
```

Constant to return from `onStartCommand(Intent, int, int)`: if this service's
process is killed while it is started (after returning from
`onStartCommand(Intent, int, int)`), then it will be scheduled for a restart
and the last delivered Intent re-delivered to it again via
`onStartCommand(Intent, int, int)`. This Intent will remain scheduled for
redelivery until the service calls `stopSelf(int)` with the
start ID provided to `onStartCommand(Intent, int, int)`. The
service will not receive a `onStartCommand(Intent,int,int)`
call with a null Intent because it will only be restarted if
it is not finished processing all Intents sent to it (and any such
pending events will be delivered at the point of restart).

Constant Value:
3
(0x00000003)

### START\_STICKY

Added in [API level 5](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int START_STICKY
```

Constant to return from `onStartCommand(Intent, int, int)`: if this service's
process is killed while it is started (after returning from
`onStartCommand(Intent, int, int)`), then leave it in the started state but
don't retain this delivered intent. Later the system will try to
re-create the service. Because it is in the started state, it will
guarantee to call `onStartCommand(Intent, int, int)` after creating the new
service instance; if there are not any pending start commands to be
delivered to the service, it will be called with a null intent
object, so you must take care to check for this.

This mode makes sense for things that will be explicitly started
and stopped to run for arbitrary periods of time, such as a service
performing background music playback.

Since Android version `Build.VERSION_CODES.S`, apps
targeting `Build.VERSION_CODES.S` or above are disallowed
to start a foreground service from the background, but the restriction
doesn't impact *restarts* of a sticky foreground service. However,
when apps start a sticky foreground service from the background,
the same restriction still applies.

Constant Value:
1
(0x00000001)

### START\_STICKY\_COMPATIBILITY

Added in [API level 5](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int START_STICKY_COMPATIBILITY
```

Constant to return from `onStartCommand(Intent, int, int)`: compatibility
version of `START_STICKY` that does not guarantee that
`onStartCommand(Intent, int, int)` will be called again after being killed.

Constant Value:
0
(0x00000000)

### STOP\_FOREGROUND\_DETACH

Added in [API level 24](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int STOP_FOREGROUND_DETACH
```

Selector for `stopForeground(int)`: if set, the notification previously supplied
to `startForeground(int, Notification)` will be detached from the service's lifecycle. The notification
will remain shown even after the service is stopped and destroyed.

Constant Value:
2
(0x00000002)

### STOP\_FOREGROUND\_LEGACY

Added in [API level 33](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
33](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int STOP_FOREGROUND_LEGACY
```

**This constant was deprecated
in API level 33.**  
Use `STOP_FOREGROUND_DETACH` instead. The legacy
behavior was inconsistent, leading to bugs around unpredictable results.

Selector for `stopForeground(int)`: equivalent to passing `false`
to the legacy API `stopForeground(boolean)`.

Constant Value:
0
(0x00000000)

### STOP\_FOREGROUND\_REMOVE

Added in [API level 24](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final int STOP_FOREGROUND_REMOVE
```

Selector for `stopForeground(int)`: if supplied, the notification previously
supplied to `startForeground(int, Notification)` will be cancelled and removed from display.

Constant Value:
1
(0x00000001)





## Public constructors

### Service

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public Service ()
```






## Public methods

### getApplication

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public final Application getApplication ()

### getForegroundServiceType

Added in [API level 29](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public final int getForegroundServiceType ()
```

If the service has become a foreground service by calling
`startForeground(int,Notification)`
or `startForeground(int,Notification,int)`, `getForegroundServiceType()`
returns the current foreground service type.

If there is no foregroundServiceType specified
in manifest, `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_NONE` is returned.

If the service is not a foreground service,
`ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_NONE` is returned.

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `int` | current foreground service type flags.   Value is either `0` or a combination of the following:  * `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_MANIFEST` * `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_NONE` * `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_DATA_SYNC` * `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK` * `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_PHONE_CALL` * `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_LOCATION` * `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_CONNECTED_DEVICE` * `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_MEDIA_PROJECTION` * `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_CAMERA` * `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_MICROPHONE` * `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_HEALTH` * `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_REMOTE_MESSAGING` * `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_SYSTEM_EXEMPTED` * `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_SHORT_SERVICE` * `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_MEDIA_PROCESSING` * `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_SPECIAL_USE` |

### onBind

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public abstract IBinder onBind (Intent intent)
```

Return the communication channel to the service. May return null if
clients can not bind to the service. The returned
`IBinder` is usually for a complex interface
that has been [described using
aidl](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/aidl).

*Note that unlike other application components, calls on to the
IBinder interface returned here may not happen on the main thread
of the process*. More information about the main thread can be found in
[Processes and
Threads](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/fundamentals/processes-and-threads).

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `intent` | `Intent`: The Intent that was used to bind to this service, as given to `Context.bindService`. Note that any extras that were included with the Intent at that point will *not* be seen here. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `IBinder` | Return an IBinder through which clients can call on to the service. |

### onConfigurationChanged

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onConfigurationChanged (Configuration newConfig)
```

Called by the system when the device configuration changes while your
component is running. Note that, unlike activities, other components
are never restarted when a configuration changes: they must always deal
with the results of the change, such as by re-retrieving resources.

At the time that this function has been called, your Resources
object will have been updated to return resource values matching the
new configuration.

For more information, read [Handling Runtime Changes](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/runtime-changes).

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `newConfig` | `Configuration`: The new device configuration.   This value cannot be `null`. |

### onCreate

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onCreate ()
```

Called by the system when the service is first created. Do not call this method directly.

### onDestroy

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onDestroy ()
```

Called by the system to notify a Service that it is no longer used and is being removed. The
service should clean up any resources it holds (threads, registered
receivers, etc) at this point. Upon return, there will be no more calls
in to this Service object and it is effectively dead. Do not call this method directly.

### onLowMemory

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onLowMemory ()
```

This is called when the overall system is running low on memory, and
actively running processes should trim their memory usage. While
the exact point at which this will be called is not defined, generally
it will happen when all background process have been killed.
That is, before reaching the point of killing processes hosting
service and foreground UI that we would like to avoid killing.

### onRebind

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onRebind (Intent intent)
```

Called when new clients have connected to the service, after it had
previously been notified that all had disconnected in its
`onUnbind(Intent)`. This will only be called if the implementation
of `onUnbind(Intent)` was overridden to return true.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `intent` | `Intent`: The Intent that was used to bind to this service, as given to `Context.bindService`. Note that any extras that were included with the Intent at that point will *not* be seen here. |

### onStart

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
15](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onStart (Intent intent, 
                int startId)
```

**This method was deprecated
in API level 15.**  
Implement `onStartCommand(Intent,int,int)` instead.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `intent` | `Intent` |
| `startId` | `int` |

### onStartCommand

Added in [API level 5](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public int onStartCommand (Intent intent, 
                int flags, 
                int startId)
```

Called by the system every time a client explicitly starts the service by calling
`Context.startService(Intent)`, providing the arguments it supplied and a
unique integer token representing the start request. Do not call this method directly.

For backwards compatibility, the default implementation calls
`onStart(Intent, int)` and returns either `START_STICKY`
or `START_STICKY_COMPATIBILITY`.

Note that the system calls this on your
service's main thread. A service's main thread is the same
thread where UI operations take place for Activities running in the
same process. You should always avoid stalling the main
thread's event loop. When doing long-running operations,
network calls, or heavy disk I/O, you should kick off a new
thread, or use `AsyncTask`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `intent` | `Intent`: The Intent supplied to `Context.startService(Intent)`, as given. This may be null if the service is being restarted after its process has gone away, and it had previously returned anything except `START_STICKY_COMPATIBILITY`. |
| `flags` | `int`: Additional data about this start request.   Value is either `0` or a combination of the following:  * `START_FLAG_REDELIVERY` * `START_FLAG_RETRY` |
| `startId` | `int`: A unique integer representing this specific request to start. Use with `stopSelfResult(int)`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `int` | The return value indicates what semantics the system should use for the service's current started state. It may be one of the constants associated with the `START_CONTINUATION_MASK` bits.   Value is one of the following:  * `START_STICKY_COMPATIBILITY` * `START_STICKY` * `START_NOT_STICKY` * `START_REDELIVER_INTENT` |

**See also:**

* `stopSelfResult(int)`

### onTaskRemoved

Added in [API level 14](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onTaskRemoved (Intent rootIntent)
```

This is called if the service is currently running and the user has
removed a task that comes from the service's application. If you have
set `ServiceInfo.FLAG_STOP_WITH_TASK`
then you will not receive this callback; instead, the service will simply
be stopped.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `rootIntent` | `Intent`: The original root Intent that was used to launch the task that is being removed. |

### onTimeout

Added in [API level 35](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onTimeout (int startId, 
                int fgsType)
```

Callback called when a particular foreground service type has timed out.

This callback is meant to give the app a small grace period of a few seconds to finish
the foreground service of the associated type - if it fails to do so, the app will crash.

The foreground service of the associated type can be stopped within the time limit by
`stopSelf()`,
`Context.stopService(android.content.Intent)` or their overloads.
`stopForeground(int)` can be used as well, which demotes the
service to a "background" service, which will soon be stopped by the system.

The specific time limit for each type (if one exists) is mentioned in the documentation
for that foreground service type. See
`dataSync` for example.

Note: time limits are restricted to a rolling 24-hour window - for example, if a
foreground service type has a time limit of 6 hours, that time counter begins as soon as the
foreground service starts. This time limit will only be reset once every 24 hours or if the
app comes into the foreground state.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `startId` | `int`: the startId passed to `onStartCommand(Intent,int,int)` when the service started. |
| `fgsType` | `int`: the `ERROR(foreground service type/android.content.pm.ServiceInfo.ForegroundServiceType foreground service type)` which caused the timeout.   Value is either `0` or a combination of the following:  * `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_MANIFEST` * `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_NONE` * `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_DATA_SYNC` * `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK` * `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_PHONE_CALL` * `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_LOCATION` * `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_CONNECTED_DEVICE` * `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_MEDIA_PROJECTION` * `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_CAMERA` * `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_MICROPHONE` * `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_HEALTH` * `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_REMOTE_MESSAGING` * `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_SYSTEM_EXEMPTED` * `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_SHORT_SERVICE` * `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_MEDIA_PROCESSING` * `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_SPECIAL_USE` |

### onTimeout

Added in [API level 34](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onTimeout (int startId)
```

Callback called on timeout for `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_SHORT_SERVICE`.
See `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_SHORT_SERVICE` for more details.

If the foreground service of type
`ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_SHORT_SERVICE`
doesn't finish even after it's timed out,
the app will be declared an ANR after a short grace period of several seconds.

Starting from Android version `Build.VERSION_CODES.VANILLA_ICE_CREAM`,
`onTimeout(int, int)` will also be called when a foreground service of type
`ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_SHORT_SERVICE` times out.
Developers do not need to implement both of the callbacks on
`Build.VERSION_CODES.VANILLA_ICE_CREAM` and onwards.

Note, even though
`ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_SHORT_SERVICE`
was added
on Android version `Build.VERSION_CODES.UPSIDE_DOWN_CAKE`,
it can be also used on
on prior android versions (just like other new foreground service types can be used).
However, because `onTimeout(int)` did not exist on prior versions,
it will never called on such versions.
Because of this, developers must make sure to stop the foreground service even if
`onTimeout(int)` is not called on such versions.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `startId` | `int`: the startId passed to `onStartCommand(Intent,int,int)` when the service started. |

### onTrimMemory

Added in [API level 14](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public void onTrimMemory (int level)
```

Called when the operating system has determined that it is a good
time for a process to trim unneeded memory from its process.
You should never compare to exact values of the level, since new
intermediate values may be added -- you will typically want to compare if
the value is greater or equal to a level you are interested in.

To retrieve the processes current trim level at any point, you can
use `ActivityManager.getMyMemoryState(RunningAppProcessInfo)`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `level` | `int`: The context of the trim, giving a hint of the amount of trimming the application may like to perform.   Value is one of the following:  * `ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_COMPLETE` * `ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_MODERATE` * `ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_BACKGROUND` * `ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_UI_HIDDEN` * `ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_RUNNING_CRITICAL` * `ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_RUNNING_LOW` * `ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_RUNNING_MODERATE` |

### onUnbind

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public boolean onUnbind (Intent intent)
```

Called when all clients have disconnected from a particular interface
published by the service. The default implementation does nothing and
returns false.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `intent` | `Intent`: The Intent that was used to bind to this service, as given to `Context.bindService`. Note that any extras that were included with the Intent at that point will *not* be seen here. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | Return true if you would like to have the service's `onRebind(Intent)` method later called when new clients bind to it. |

### startForeground

Added in [API level 5](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public final void startForeground (int id, 
                Notification notification)
```

If your service is started (running through `Context.startService(Intent)`), then
also make this service run in the foreground, supplying the ongoing
notification to be shown to the user while in this state.
By default started services are background, meaning that their process won't be given
foreground CPU scheduling (unless something else in that process is foreground) and,
if the system needs to kill them to reclaim more memory (such as to display a large page in a
web browser), they can be killed without too much harm. You use
`startForeground(int, Notification)` if killing your service would be disruptive to the user, such as
if your service is performing background music playback, so the user
would notice if their music stopped playing.

Note that calling this method does *not* put the service in the started state
itself, even though the name sounds like it. You must always call
`startService(Intent)` first to tell the system it should keep the service running,
and then use this method to tell it to keep it running harder.

Apps targeting API `Build.VERSION_CODES.P` or later must request
the permission `Manifest.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE` in order to use
this API.

Apps built with SDK version `Build.VERSION_CODES.Q` or later can specify
the foreground service types using attribute `R.attr.foregroundServiceType` in
service element of manifest file. The value of attribute
`R.attr.foregroundServiceType` can be multiple flags ORed together.

**Note:**
Beginning with SDK Version `Build.VERSION_CODES.S`,
apps targeting SDK Version `Build.VERSION_CODES.S`
or higher are not allowed to start foreground services from the background.
See
[Behavior changes: Apps targeting Android 12](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-12)
for more details.

**Note:**
Beginning with SDK Version `Build.VERSION_CODES.UPSIDE_DOWN_CAKE`,
apps targeting SDK Version `Build.VERSION_CODES.UPSIDE_DOWN_CAKE`
or higher are not allowed to start foreground services without specifying a valid
foreground service type in the manifest attribute
`R.attr.foregroundServiceType`.
See
[Behavior changes: Apps targeting Android 14](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/behavior-changes-14)
for more details.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | `int`: The identifier for this notification as per `NotificationManager.notify(int, Notification)`; must not be 0. |
| `notification` | `Notification`: The Notification to be displayed. |

| Throws | |
| --- | --- |
| `ForegroundServiceStartNotAllowedException` | If the app targeting API is `Build.VERSION_CODES.S` or later, and the service is restricted from becoming foreground service due to background restriction. |
| `InvalidForegroundServiceTypeException` | If the app targeting API is `Build.VERSION_CODES.UPSIDE_DOWN_CAKE` or later, and the manifest attribute `R.attr.foregroundServiceType` is set to invalid types(i.e. `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_NONE`). |
| `MissingForegroundServiceTypeException` | If the app targeting API is `Build.VERSION_CODES.UPSIDE_DOWN_CAKE` or later, and the manifest attribute `R.attr.foregroundServiceType` is not set. |
| `SecurityException` | If the app targeting API is `Build.VERSION_CODES.UPSIDE_DOWN_CAKE` or later and doesn't have the permission to start the foreground service with the specified type in the manifest attribute `R.attr.foregroundServiceType`. |

### startForeground

Added in [API level 29](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public final void startForeground (int id, 
                Notification notification, 
                int foregroundServiceType)
```

An overloaded version of `startForeground(int,Notification)` with additional
foregroundServiceType parameter.

Apps built with SDK version `Build.VERSION_CODES.Q` or later can specify

`R.attr.foregroundServiceType` can be multiple flags ORed together.

The foregroundServiceType parameter must be a subset flags of what is specified in
manifest attribute `R.attr.foregroundServiceType`, if not, an
IllegalArgumentException is thrown. Specify foregroundServiceType parameter as
`ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_MANIFEST` to use all flags that
is specified in manifest attribute foregroundServiceType.

### stopForeground

Added in [API level 24](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public final void stopForeground (int notificationBehavior)
```

Remove this service from foreground state, allowing it to be killed if
more memory is needed. This does not stop the service from running (for that
you use `stopSelf()` or related methods), just takes it out of the
foreground state.

If `STOP_FOREGROUND_REMOVE` is supplied, the service's associated
notification will be cancelled immediately.

If `STOP_FOREGROUND_DETACH` is supplied, the service's association
with the notification will be severed. If the notification had not yet been
shown, due to foreground-service notification deferral policy, it is
immediately posted when `stopForeground(STOP_FOREGROUND_DETACH)`
is called. In all cases, the notification remains shown
even after this service is stopped fully and destroyed.

If `zero` is passed as the argument, the result will be the legacy
behavior as defined prior to Android L: the notification will remain posted until
the service is fully stopped, at which time it will automatically be cancelled.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `notificationBehavior` | `int`: the intended behavior for the service's associated notification.   Value is one of the following:  * `STOP_FOREGROUND_LEGACY` * `STOP_FOREGROUND_REMOVE` * `STOP_FOREGROUND_DETACH` |

**See also:**

* `startForeground(int,Notification)`
* `STOP_FOREGROUND_DETACH`
* `STOP_FOREGROUND_REMOVE`

### stopForeground

Added in [API level 5](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
  
Deprecated in
[API level
33](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public final void stopForeground (boolean removeNotification)
```

**This method was deprecated
in API level 33.**  
call `stopForeground(int)` and pass either
`STOP_FOREGROUND_REMOVE` or `STOP_FOREGROUND_DETACH`
explicitly instead.

Legacy version of `stopForeground(int)`.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `removeNotification` | `boolean`: If true, the `STOP_FOREGROUND_REMOVE` selector will be passed to `stopForeground(int)`; otherwise `STOP_FOREGROUND_LEGACY` will be passed. |

**See also:**

* `stopForeground(int)`
* `startForeground(int,Notification)`

### stopSelf

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public final void stopSelf ()
```

Stop the service, if it was previously started. This is the same as
calling `Context.stopService(Intent)` for this particular service.

**See also:**

* `stopSelfResult(int)`

### stopSelf

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public final void stopSelf (int startId)
```

Old version of `stopSelfResult(int)` that doesn't return a result.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `startId` | `int` |

**See also:**

* `stopSelfResult(int)`

### stopSelfResult

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public final boolean stopSelfResult (int startId)
```

Stop the service if the most recent time it was started was
startId. This is the same as calling `Context.stopService(Intent)` for this particular service but allows you to
safely avoid stopping if there is a start request from a client that you
haven't yet seen in `onStart(Intent, int)`.

*Be careful about ordering of your calls to this function.*.
If you call this function with the most-recently received ID before
you have called it for previously received IDs, the service will be
immediately stopped anyway. If you may end up processing IDs out
of order (such as by dispatching them on separate threads), then you
are responsible for stopping them in the same order you received them.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `startId` | `int`: The most recent start identifier received in `onStart(Intent, int)`. |

| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | Returns true if the startId matches the last start request and the service will be stopped, else false. |

**See also:**

* `stopSelf()`



## Protected methods

### attachBaseContext

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
protected void attachBaseContext (Context newBase)
```

Set the base context for this ContextWrapper. All calls will then be
delegated to the base context. Throws
IllegalStateException if a base context has already been set.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `newBase` | `Context`: The new base context for this wrapper. |

### dump

Added in [API level 1](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
protected void dump (FileDescriptor fd, 
                PrintWriter writer, 
                String[] args)
```

Print the Service's state into the given stream. This gets invoked if
you run "adb shell dumpsys activity service <yourservicename>"
(note that for this command to work, the service must be running, and
you must specify a fully-qualified service name).
This is distinct from "dumpsys <servicename>", which only works for
named system services and which invokes the `IBinder.dump` method
on the `IBinder` interface registered with ServiceManager.

| Parameters | |
| --- | --- |
| `fd` | `FileDescriptor`: The raw file descriptor that the dump is being sent to. |
| `writer` | `PrintWriter`: The PrintWriter to which you should dump your state. This will be closed for you after you return. |
| `args` | `String`: additional arguments to the dump request. |
