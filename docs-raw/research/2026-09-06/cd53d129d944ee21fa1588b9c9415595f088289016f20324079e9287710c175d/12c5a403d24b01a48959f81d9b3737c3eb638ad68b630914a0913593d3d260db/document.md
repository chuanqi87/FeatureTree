# Configuring background execution modes

Indicate the background services your app requires to continue executing in the
background in iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, and watchOS.

## Overview

Typically, an app is in a suspended state when it’s in the background. However,
there are a limited number of background execution modes your app can support
that enable it to run when in the background, such as playing audio, receiving
location updates, or processing scheduled tasks. For apps that adopt one or
more of these modes, the system launches or resumes the app, in the background,
and affords it time to process any related events.

Use background execution modes sparingly because overuse can negatively impact
device performance and battery life. If an alternative to executing in the
background exists, use the alternative instead. For example, apps can
use the significant-change location service to receive location events as an
alternative to using the Location updates background mode.

Before you can select the background execution modes your app requires, follow
the steps in [Add a capability](/documentation/Xcode/adding-capabilities-to-your-app#Add-a-capability) to add the
Background Modes capability to your app’s target.

The list shows a range of capabilities from Background Modes to Game Center, and the Background Modes capability is in a selected state. The text on the information pane explains that, with Background Modes, your app can provide specific background services that need to continue running while in the background. It also advises using Background Modes sparingly and only by apps that provide the indicated services. And when alternatives exist for running in the background, to use those alternatives instead.](images/com.apple.Xcode/background-modes@2x.png)

The background execution modes that appear after you add the capability depend
on the target’s platform. For watchOS apps with separate WatchKit extensions, you need to add the capability to the
WatchKit Extension target.

> Note: The Background Modes capability isn’t available for macOS apps.

### Specify the background modes your app requires

Before your app can leverage one or more background execution modes, you need to declare the modes it requires by performing the following:

1. Select your project in Xcode’s Project navigator.
2. Select the app’s target in the Targets list.
3. Click the Signing & Capabilities tab in the project editor.
4. Find the Background Modes capability.
5. Select one or more background execution modes using the corresponding
   checkboxes.
6. For watchOS apps, choose the appropriate session type from the pop-up
   menu. For more information, see <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/WatchKit/using-extended-runtime-sessions>.

The list of available modes includes Audio, AirPlay, and Picture in Picture; Location Updates; Voice over IP; External accessory communication; Uses Bluetooth LE accessories; Acts as a Bluetooth LE accessory; Background fetch; Remote notifications; Background processing; Uses Nearby Interaction; and Push to Talk. The checkbox for the Background fetch mode is selected.](images/com.apple.Xcode/modes@2x.png)

Xcode adds the <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/BundleResources/Information-Property-List/UIBackgroundModes>
array to your app’s `Info.plist` file, if it isn’t already present, and uses the
modes you select to populate the array with the necessary values.

Apple’s platforms support these background execution modes:
